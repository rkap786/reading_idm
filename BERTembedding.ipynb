The scary thing about being so tall when you're so young is that people automatically treat you as if you're older. Size implies maturity. Yes, I was the size of an adult (actually, bigger than most!), but I was still just a kid. And acting more like an adult wouldn't win me any friends. As a card-carrying^1 Good Boy, I wanted to meet adults' expectations and get their praise, but as a Regular Kid, I wanted to be like my peers and get their friendship. . . . \\n   I walked into school that first day resplendent^2 in my blue blazer and slacks, the school uniform. We all looked like baby-faced accountants in training. I noticed some of my old classmates from St. Jude, the ones who had turned their backs on me, and we continued our policy of actively ignoring one another. I felt the pain of their betrayal, but I forced my face to remain expressionless. I couldn't let them see that they had hurt me. I shoved the pain deep down into the coldest part of my heart. I was here to study hard at academics and to work hard at basketball under my new coach, Jack Donahue. I was here to excel. Nothing else mattered.\\n   I did excel. I made the honor roll my first semester, pleasing my parents and teachers. Learning came naturally to me. I loved reading, especially about history and adventure stories like _The Three Musketeers_. Basketball, however, I had to work at to do well in. But the fierce competitor that had been awakened in me loved challenges. . . . \\n   My refuge^3 from the explosive turmoil^4 outside, and the implosive turmoil I had started to feel inside, was basketball. The practices were so exhausting that I barely had time to think about anything else. Every school day I crawled out of bed early, went to school, practiced basketball until five o'clock, staggered home, powered through my homework, zoned out in front of the TV, and went to bed.\\n   Weekends, I hung out with my only close friend left in the projects, Norbert. We would shut ourselves in my room to play chess and talk about our plans for the future. He was determined to become a draftsman, making detailed drawings for engineers who were inventing wonderful new machines. I was going to be an architect and create futuristic buildings like the ones we saw on the TV show _The Jetsons_.\\n   Because the civil rights movement was in the news every day, both of us had started to take an interest in finding out more about our ethnic origins.\\n   \\\"You know, we invented the yo-yo,\\\" Norbert, who was part Filipino, bragged one day in my room. . . . \\n   Then I'd put on the latest jazz album by Sonny Rollins and say, \\\"Yeah, but we invented that.\\\" \\n   And back and forth we'd go, trying to one-up the other in a cultural heritage version of rock, paper, scissors. This kind of competition required that we do research. We even took the subway to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to find out more about Filipino and African cultures. Most important, I had a friend in whom I could confide any thought or feeling, knowing he would never make fun of me.\\n   The demands of high school cut into the time I could spend with Norbert. I had the studying part down, but the basketball part was as rocky as ever. As a freshman, my style of play reflected my personality: politely passive. I had some skills, but I didn't have an aggressive nature. The good players around me knew how to play rough, use their bodies with authority, and power their way to a rebound. I felt like a pinball bouncing off players rather than making them bounce off me. I knew I had to toughen up, and I was committed to getting better, but it wasn't happening fast enough. . . . \\n   On the morning our varsity team was scheduled to play a preconference game against Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, Coach Donahue surprised me by taking me into his office. I figured he was going to discuss his disappointment in my progress as a player, maybe even say something about it all being a big mistake. That I didn't belong. Instead, he handed me a varsity uniform.\\n   \\\"You'll be suiting up against Erasmus today,\\\" he said.\\n   I just stood there, the folded uniform in my hand. Was this a joke? \\n   \\\"Don't you have a class to go to?\\\" he asked. He pretended to be all business, but I could tell by the slight grin he was enjoying my dumbfounded reaction.\\n   When I unfolded the jersey, I saw the number 33\\u2014the one I had picked in seventh grade to honor the football player Mel Triplett. Even my fear of playing poorly and letting everyone down couldn't overcome my pride at walking out of his office with that uniform. I had no idea that would be the number I would wear for the rest of my basketball career. I hurried away on a mission to tell anyone who would listen that I would be playing varsity that afternoon. All day, as I sat in classes and walked the hallways and ate lunch, I allowed myself to imagine the game and the parts where I scored impossible shots, made incredible passes, snagged rebounds like a machine. Would the team insist on carrying me out of the gym on their shoulders or just award me the game ball?\\n   Neither. We got slaughtered. Afterward, I sat in the locker room and cried.\\\"\",\n          \" \\\"Oh, no!\\\" said Stella, as the string of her shark kite tangled with the string of a biplane kite. The biplane dove toward the ground, the grinning shark spiraling behind it. \\\"I feel like a spider in a web,\\\" she said, frowning as the tangled strings drifted down around her.\\n . \\\"I think that shark kite has too many strings,\\\" said the owner of the biplane kite, as he untangled his string from Stellas.\\n . \\\"My kite doesn't have too many strings,\\\" said Stella. \\\"It's a grownup's kite. That's why it's complicated to fly.\\\"\\n . \\\"You should really try flying a paper plate,\\\" said Stella's friend Robby. Stella looked at Robby's kite. He had decorated a plate with stickers and a long yellow streamer and attached a string to it. Right now, his paper plate was flying so high that Stella could hardly see it.\\n . \\\"Your shark kite hasn't flown as high as my paper plate all day,\\\" said Robby, wiping his nose on his sleeve.\\n . \\\"Paper plates are for babies,\\\" said Stella. She felt like being mean, because her shark kite could hardly fly.\\n . Just then Stella noticed a fluffy pink jellyfish kite sailing overhead, bobbing a little as it passed Robby's paper plate. Stella wished she could trade her shark for that jellyfish.\\n . Stella wound the string of her fallen kite around its spool. Then, holding the string near the shark's belly, she started running. If she could catch a tiny breeze, her kite would fly.\\n . \\\"Stella, it's almost time to go!\\\" called Stella's mother from a park bench in the shade. \\\"We have to pick up your sister at the pool.\\\"\\n . \\\"Come on, shark, fly!\\\" Stella said as she tossed the kite into a little puff of wind. For a moment, the shark looked as if it was swimming up into the sky. Then, it dove back toward the grass, teeth and all.\\n . \\\"Maybe it's too heavy,\\\" said Robby. He tugged lightly on the string of his paper plate, which dipped gently in the air.\\n . \\\"It's not heavier than that one,\\\" said Stella. She pointed at an enormous monster truck kite gliding past Robby's paper plate. The monster truck had big black wings. \\\"I bet that kite weighs more than you do, Robby,\\\" said Stella.\\n . Robby squinted at the sky. \\\"No, it doesn't. I weigh forty pounds,\\\" he said.\\n  .\\\"Stella, your sister is waiting,\\\" her mother called again.\\n . \\\"One more try, Mom,\\\" yelled Stella, running with the shark. This time, the shark kept its nose pointed downward the whole time, refusing to fly at all. Stella tripped over the shark's fin and fell into the dirt.\\n .\\\"Come on, brush yourself off, Stella,\\\" said her mother. \\\"We're leaving.\\\"\\n . \\\"You can take my paper plate if you want,\\\" said Robby. \\\"At least you'll get to fly something today.\\\" He looked at Stella hopefully.\\n . Stella sighed. Robby's paper plate was nothing like the fancy shark she had imagined flying. But it did fly pretty high.\\n . \\\"O.K.,\\\" Stella agreed with a shrug. She took Robby's string and felt the strong, steady pull of the kite dancing at its end. She gave a slight tug. The paper plate swirled and floated even higher on the breeze. Stella smiled at Robby. \\\"You're right,\\\" she said. \\\"Paper plates do make good kites.\\\"\\n . \\\"You can keep it,\\\" said Robby. \\\"I'll make another one next weekend.\\\"\\n . \\\"Want to borrow the shark, then?\\\" asked Stella, handing the tangle of strings and the grinning shark to Robby. \\\"Maybe you can make it fly.\\\"\\n . \\\"Hey, thanks,\\\" he said. \\\"See you next weekend, Stella.\\\"\\n . Stella and her mother walked toward the car. Stella held the string of her new kite, and the paper plate sailed along above them, its yellow streamer wriggling through the air.\\n . \\\"What happened to your shark kite?\\\" asked Stella's mother.\\n . \\\"Robby and I swapped for a while,\\\" Stella replied.\\n . As Stella rode in the car, she held on to the paper plate's string and watched it bob next to her window. \\\"I bet that big old shark couldn't do this!\\\" she laughed.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"QNoUnq\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1116,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2019staargr5readingtest2.2_1.9\",\n          \"2019-released-items-ela-g3.1.3\",\n          \"2019staargr7readingtest.5.38\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"QuestionText\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1068,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Which quotation *best* reveals Miyax's attitude toward Amaroq?\",\n          \" What does the reader learn from the stage directions in scene 2?\",\n          \" Use \\\"Public Speaking Is Easier When a Cute Dog Is Listening\\\" and \\\"Assembly\\\" to answer the following question.\\nRead lines 16\\u201319 from the poem \\\"Assembly.\\\" \\n\\\"Manny nudges me when it's time for my solo.; Legs like spaghetti, I worry that I might faint.\\\"\\nWhich sentences from the selection \\\"Public Speaking Is Easier When a Cute Dog Is Listening\\\" best express a *SIMILAR* feeling?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Option1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1099,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" The wind direction can increase the amount of water taken into the air.\",\n          \"The endophyte mixture is clearly visible on seeds.
