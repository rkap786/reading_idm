This is a small area in the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists discovered that plant and animal life in this area rely on plants called algae (al-jee). Many creatures live in or eat the algae.

By doing this the algae will continue to grow and remain healthy.\\n Another \\u201chope spot\\u201d is the Gulf of Mexico Deep Reefs. Reefs are large ridges on the ocean floor.

At this event kids helped the ocean and had fun at the same time.\\n Mission Blue believes young people can make a big difference. They can raise money to clean ocean waters or save sea animals.
