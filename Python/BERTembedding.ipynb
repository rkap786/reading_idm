She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences.    Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying.    At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground.    Her father wouldn't hear of it. \\\"Absolutely not,\\\" he said. \\\"No free-fall!\\\"    But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. \\\"Just one time,\\\" he said, \\\"but you have to be careful and do it the right way.\\\"    He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump.    Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet's father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, Janet Guthrie\\u2014A Life at Full Throttle, Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn't fly off.   By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot's license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.   After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn't satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120\\u2014the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.   At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races\\u2014and winning them.    Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing.    A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers' school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing\\u2014the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.   Guthrie's career started to pick up speed.    She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country's most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport.    That's when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. This has to be a prank, thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn't kidding. Could she drive a \\\"championship\\\" car? That was the big question.    With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years.    \\\"Before she would agree to drive for me,\\\" Vollstedt said, \\\"she wanted to see if she could handle the car.   Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles.    To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt's test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. How am I going to drive a racing car? she worried. Will I miss my big chance?    Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn't believe the feeling. \\\"What a thrill,\\\" she said. \\\"It was like going to the moon.\\\"    Vollstedt was impressed with her time\\u2014an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph.    Test passed.    She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.\\\"\",\n          \"If you were in the school band, you might play the trumpet, the violin, or the flute, but how about the marimba, the oud, or the zurna? Although these may sound like ingredients in an exotic recipe, they are actually musical instruments\\u2014some of them hundreds of years old. Many of the instruments we know and play today, like the piano, the guitar, and the oboe, evolved from these older instruments. The instruments came to America with people who emigrated from countries all around the world, bringing music, and a little bit of their culture, with them.     *Percussion Instruments*   As you can see from the picture, the xylophone is played with a padded mallet (which looks like a hammer).. . .   Playing the xylophone well requires great precision to hit just the right bar at the right time, which produces a musical tone. The xylophone is a percussion instrument (one that is played either by striking, shaking or scraping it) that likely originated in Southeast Asia or Oceania. It's one of the central instruments of the music of Africa, possibly being brought to that continent through trade or people migrating from other places. Slaves from Africa brought the xylophone with them when they were taken to Latin America, and from there it eventually made its way to the United States. Today's xylophone has bars arranged in two rows, sort of like the keys of a piano, and rests on a stand. . .   The marimba is another percussion instrument that is played with a rubber mallet. Marimba is the African name for xylophone. It resembles that instrument in shape, but it's bigger and has a wider range of notesThe fact that marimba songs were well liked by Americans shows the increased exposure the public had to foreign styles of music.    The hammered dulcimer, in its simplest form, is an instrument with 13 strings, played by beating the strings with a small hammer. The name \\\"dulcimer\\\" comes from Latin and means \\\"sweet sound.\\\" The hammered dulcimer developed from the cimbalom, an instrument from Hungary with 48 strings that is played with small hammers. The piano of today has evolved from both the cimbalom and the hammered dulcimer. Have you ever seen the inside of a piano? When someone presses a piano key, a lever raises a hammer that then strikes the string producing a musical note. How do you suppose this came about?     *Stringed Instruments*   Rock and roll music, as we know it, wouldn't exist without the guitar, but would it have existed without the oud? The oud is an Arabic instrument that, as you can see from the picture, looks a lot like a round guitar. The oud was brought to Spain and eventually turned into the lute. The lute is the instrument that evolved into the guitar. Today the oud is still played in Arab countries.. . .   Around 1915, Hawaiian performers on vaudeville^1 and in other shows made Hawaiian-style songs very popular. Hawaiian music was played with a Hawaiian guitar, an instrument with a long sounding board and six to eight steel strings. The instrument is played by touching the strings with a steel bar or some hard object. Although it's not clear who invented the steel guitar style, legend has it that the first person to develop this technique was Hawaiian schoolboy Joseph Kekuku. He discovered the sound while walking along a railroad track strumming his guitar with a metal bolt that he found along the tracks.   In country and bluegrass music, the band plays stringed instruments like the guitar, banjo, fiddle, stand-up bass, and mandolin, but did you know that years ago, a band might play these same instruments made out of gourds? Gourds are hard-shelled, round-shaped fruits. During the Great Depression, people couldn't afford store-bought instruments so they made their own. . . .     *Wind Instruments*   Just like percussion and strings, most wind instruments evolved from much older folk instruments. The misnice is a bagpipe-like instrument made out of the skin of a goat. In Europe, references to the misnice are found as early as the ninth century. The misnice was found in North Africa and in somewhat different forms in Eastern Europe (Serbia, Hungary, Ukraine, and elsewhere). . . .    The zurna, also known as the surna, is an instrument from Islamic areas including Iran, Mesopotamia, and Syria. The popularity of the zurna quickly spread through areas conquered by the Arabs. The Arabs first used it in military bands, and later used it to greet important persons, mark the beginnings of pilgrimages, and in other important ceremonies. Today the zurna still exists as a folk instrument used mainly in festive village music in Islamic areas, as well as Greece, Cyprus, and Armenia. The modern day version of the zurna is the oboe, which is a staple of any symphony orchestra.    If you don't have any instruments at all, and you can't make one, you can always whistle. Whistling is a way to use your vocal cords as a musical instrument. Just put your lips together and blow, and you can take that song with you anywhere you go.\\\"\",\n          \" When she was just seven years old, Michelle knew with certainty that she wanted to be a photographer when she grew up. That year she received her first camera, a small disposable one to use on the family vacation. At first she randomly clicked the button, not giving much thought to what she was doing. When her father examined her blurred images and aimless shots, he advised Michelle to look through the lens and think about what the resulting picture would look like. The next day Michelle saw a family of ducks, and remembering what her father had said, she lay down on the ground and waited for a duckling to waddle near her. That picture still hangs on her bedroom wall.. Now, six years later, Michelle was attempting to <u>capture<u> a sunset for a local photography contest. She groaned as storm clouds rolled in before the sun had a chance to cast its vibrant colors across the sky.. \\\"Mom, I don't think I'm ever going to get this shot!\\\" Michelle complained, putting her camera equipment on the kitchen table and sighing with exasperation.. \\\"Still no luck?\\\" Mom asked. \\\"Why don't you use one of your previous photographs? You have some captivating pictures on the computer.\\\". \\\"I can't\\u2014the contest rules specifically say the photos have to be taken with a traditional camera, not a digital one. We turn in the roll of film, it gets developed, and then we choose which picture we want to enter into the contest, just to make sure everything is fair.\\\". \\\"I hope the weather clears up by the weekend, then, but I'm wondering why a sunset is so important,\\\" Mom mused.. \\\"The theme of the contest is tranquillity,\\\" Michelle explained. \\\"I have pictures of the cat lounging in the sun, light reflecting off the calm water in the pond\\u2014images like that. But honestly, I feel most peaceful when I study the colorful display of an evening sunset, and I'm hoping the contest judges will feel the same way when they see a picture of the sunset,\\\" Michelle said with another sigh.. Six-year-old Zach came out of his room when he saw Michelle. \\\"Hi! What are you doing? Are you going to take more pictures? You want to take a picture of me? Look!\\\" Zach put both arms over his head in a muscle-man pose. \\\"Not right now, Zach,\\\" said Michelle, laughing at his juvenile antics. \\\"I have to do my homework and think about something besides the contest.\\\" Zach frowned and went back into his room.. The next afternoon Michelle felt inspired when she saw clear skies, so she again set up her equipment on the hill behind her house as Zach ambled along beside her. Soon the sky glowed orange, gold, and pink as the sun drifted toward the horizon.. \\\"This is it, Zach,\\\" Michelle whispered hopefully as she carefully lined up her shot. \\\"If the colors show up just right, I think I'll have the winning picture.\\\". \\\"It's just a silly sunset. They happen all the time. I think you should take one of me . . . see, I can be peaceful.\\\" Zach closed his eyes and lay on the grass.. Michelle grinned. \\\"Maybe tomorrow; I'm waiting till the sun reaches the ground. Right . . . about . . . now.\\\" Michelle clicked the camera button. \\\"That was perfect!\\\" she exclaimed triumphantly. \\\"Let's go home.\\\". The next morning Michelle woke earlier than usual, pleased with her picture-taking accomplishments. Picking up her camera, she paused, noticing that she could take one more picture to complete the roll of film. She walked across the hall to Zach's room and stood outside the door. \\\"Hey, buddy, want me to take your picture now?\\\" When she heard nothing in response, she opened the door and peered inside. Zach, normally as active as a fly in a doughnut shop, was on his stomach sleeping quietly. Stuffed animals were scattered around him, a teddy bear was tucked under one arm, and a blanket was wrapped possessively around one foot. Sunlight cast its beam across his back. Carefully Michelle knelt down and took a picture. \\\"Mom will like this,\\\" she thought, as she shut Zach's door quietly.. A week later Michelle hurried her mother into the photo shop that was hosting the contest. The clerk handed her the envelope with her pictures in it and reminded her: \\\"Remember, there is a one picture maximum, and it must be from this group of photos.\\\". Michelle nodded as she moved to a table. Her hands trembled as she opened the envelope, and she began to look at her pictures one by one. The cat one was cheery; he certainly looked content. The pond picture was tranquil, too, with its still water. But the sunset picture was the one she was most eager to see. There it was: bright colors layered toward the sky, and the sun delicately balanced on the horizon. It was as near perfection as Michelle had dreamed it would be..

It echoed in the gym and I am sure could be heard throughout Rancho Rosetta.. \\\"She kicked the ball!\\\" someone howled.. I could have just died.. Somehow I managed to struggle through the rest of the game. Not making eye contact with anyone helped, although I am sure my teammates were miffed that I kept bumping into them.. When at last the game was over, I plopped down against the bleachers, rummaged through my briefcase, and fished out a bag of Cheetos and a Gatorade. After I tried in vain to twist the cap off my drink, the girl sitting next to me took the bottle from me andopened it on the first try. Of course, I'm sure I had loosened it quite a bit.. I studied the bottle opener and recognized her as one of the few who did not laugh at me.. \\\"Hi,\\\" the girl said.. \\\"How do you do?\\\" I answered with some trepidation.. \\\"I'm Emily and I just moved here.

She paused for a breath, and I seized the chance to get a word in. \\\"I'm Millicent L. Min. Yes. Yes. Ha!

The girl tossed formalities aside and continued chatting. I smiled and waited patiently to find out why she thought we were friends. To my delight, I was surprisingly at ease with Emily. We found ourselves finishing each other's sentences. It was so liberating to talk with someone my own age without the topic of my being a genius coming up and getting in the way.. \\\"My mom thinks volleyball will be good for me . . . you know, get coordinated and meet new people, blah, blah, blah,\\\" she confided as she let down her ponytail and shook it out.. \\\"So tell me, why are you here?

I could have explained that because I went through school at an accelerated rate, I was never expected to fully participate in physical education.
