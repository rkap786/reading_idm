If she was concerned, it was only for a moment. Her heart leapt when she learned the identity of the culprit\\u2014David Greybeard, one of the chimpanzees she'd been studying. According to Goodall's camp cook, the chimpanzee had spent about an hour eating fruit from one of the oil palms that grew nearby. After having his fill of the nutlike fruit, he went into Goodall's tent and took her bananas. \\n   It was the summer of 1961. For a year, Goodall had been studying the chimps living in Gombe Stream Reserve near Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa. She watched the chimps, observed their unique features, and gave them each his or her own name. But every time she drew closer to them, the chimps ran away in fear. The day a chimp actually visited her camp and was brave enough to enter her tent marked a breakthrough in her work. With hope that David Greybeard would reappear the next day, Goodall put out some bananas and stayed in camp instead of going into the forest as she normally would. \\n   The morning passed without any sign of a chimp. As the afternoon dragged on, Goodall grew disappointed. She feared that David Greybeard's visit might have been a one-time event. However, at around 4 p.m., Goodall heard a noise in the bushes across from her tent. She watched as David Greybeard entered the camp. Just like the day before, he went to one of the oil palms and began eating nuts. When he'd had his fill, the chimp took the bananas that Goodall had left for him.\\n   During the next five days, the calm and curious chimp came to Goodall's camp to eat nuts three times. Each time he visited, he'd also help himself to bananas that she put out for him. About a month later, David Greybeard began feasting on the nuts that he spotted in another tree at camp. During one of these visits, the big chimp with the dense white beard showed even more trust toward his camp host. He took a banana right from Goodall's hand.\\n   David Greybeard's trust in Goodall made her research a great deal easier. The chimp no longer feared her and even approached her out in the forest. After seeing him interacting with Goodall, the other chimps became less afraid. In time, they let her get closer to them, too.\\n   As Goodall continued her studies of the chimps, she made discoveries about the animals that surprised the scientific community. She found that chimps are more like human beings than scientists had once believed. Today, more than 45 years after she first set foot in Gombe, Goodall's research continues, and she's known worldwide as the foremost expert on the behavior of chimpanzees. Goodall's career began as a childhood wish to see African animals in their natural environments. As an adult, she made that wish come true through hard work and perseverance. She also opened the door for other women to become ethnologists, scientists who study animal behavior.\",\n          \" \\\"Flash! Lightning streaks from a dark cloud.\\n Crash! Thunder shakes our roofs and windows. A lightning storm dazzles the sky like flickering fireworks.\\n\\nLightning Begins\\n High above the ground, water droplets and ice crystals swirl and swarm inside the moving clouds. The tiny particles bump into one another. When the particles rush together, they become charged. Electricity is created.\\n \\nLightning is Electricity\\n A single stroke of lightning carries millions of volts of electricity. Each stroke heats the air in its path to as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,760 degrees Celsius). That is five times as hot as the surface of the sun.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thunder and Lightning\\n The heat from lightning makes the air expand quickly. Expanding air makes a booming, bursting sound like a firecracker. This is the sound of thunder. Thunder and lightning happen at the same time. Light travels faster than sound. This is why we often see the flash before we hear the boom.\\n\\nHow Far Lightning Travels\\n Lightning can flash faster than you can blink. During a single flash, lightning can streak down to the ground and back up to the clouds. A lightning stroke that flashes down to earth can stretch up to nine miles (14 kilometers). That's taller than the world's highest mountain. Lightning flashes from cloud to cloud can travel even longer distances.\\n Ribbon lightning darts from the sky. It looks like jagged streaks side by side. Forked lightning looks like an upside-down tree. The branches of electricity reach through the clouds. Sheet lightning streaks inside a cloud. The cloud lights up like a bright, white sheet. Heat lightning happens during the hot summer. It looks like faraway flashes in the sky. Heat lightning is too far away for its thunder to be heard.\\n\\nLightning Around the World\\n Every day, lightning flashes from thousands of thunderstorms around the world. Every second, more than 100 lightning bolts hit the ground. Lightning can strike a tree or dry grass. When this happens, a wildfire can start. Lightning bolts can hit tall buildings. They also can hit electrical towers, houses, and cars.\\n Flash! Lightning is streaking through the clouds. Every flash is another display of nature's fireworks.\\n\\nFast Facts\\n It does not have to be raining outside for lightning to strike. Lightning can strike both before and after the rain falls, or even when there is no rain at all. Lightning helps nature by putting nitrogen into the ground and air. Nitrogen is a nutrient. That means it feeds plants and helps them grow.\\n\\nSafety Tips\\n Windows, water faucets, pipes, telephones, and electrical outlets can be dangerous when there is lightning in the sky. You should not run water or talk on the phone if you see lightning. You could get an electrical shock.\\n Benjamin Franklin once flew a kite in a lightning storm. That is how he learned about electricity. But today, we know lightning is very dangerous. If you see lightning, you should go indoors right away.\\\"\",\n          \"Layla knew the grin on her face stretched from ear to ear. She just couldn't help it. Was there anything better than spending a school day exploring a national park? Layla didn't think so. She loved being outside because there was always something new to discover. This was only the second field trip she had ever been on, but Layla was certain this would be the best one of her school career. \\n  The group's hike had just begun, yet Layla had already seen and learned about many interesting things. She listened carefully as the tour guide pointed to a plant covered with tiny yellow flowers. The guide explained that butterflies loved this native Texas plant called lantana. Then she gathered the group to move ahead. \\n  As Layla got close to the lantana, she couldn't believe her luck. A beautiful orange butterfly with black and white spots had landed on one of the tiny yellow flowers. Layla quickly grabbed her camera and snapped a picture. As she tucked her camera back in her backpack, something on the trail caught her eye. Layla picked up the object. It looked like a rock that had been broken in half. When she turned it over in her hand, Layla gasped in surprise. She could see that the rock was not solid all the way through. Along the inside wall of the hollow rock were tiny, beautiful crystals. \\n  Layla gazed at the little twinkling gift tucked inside the rock. She was so absorbed in her discovery that she did not hear her classmate Cooper walking behind her. Cooper leaned over Layla's shoulder and said, \\\"You found a geode? Cool!\\\" \\n  Layla jumped. \\\"A what?\\\" she asked. \\n  \\\"A geode. It's a kind of rock with crystals inside. That's a nice one. Quick! Hide it before the tour guide sees it.\\\"\\n  Layla quickly shoved it into the pocket of her jacket. Then she turned, looking over her shoulder to see where the tour guide was. She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the guide far down the trail with the rest of the group. \\n  \\\"I'm not sure I should keep it,\\\" Layla said. \\\"The tour guide might like to see it and tell us what she knows about it. Besides, don't you remember what she told us?\\\" \\n  Cooper rolled his eyes. \\\"Yeah, yeah. \\u2018Take only pictures. Leave only footprints.' But there are probably a million of those rocks lying around in this area. Do you really think they are going to miss this one rock? You know what I think? It will make an awesome souvenir.\\\" With that, Cooper jogged down the trail to catch up with the rest of the class. \\n  Layla bit her lip uncertainly as her fingers touched the rock inside her pocket. \\\"It would give me something to help me remember the trip,\\\" she thought. But Layla could not ignore the heavy feeling that had settled in her heart. \\n  Take only pictures. Leave only footprints. The tour guide's words played over and over in Layla's mind.\\n  As she stood on the edge of the trail, Layla suddenly noticed the cool breeze, and it comforted her. The sweet scent of the honeysuckle blossoms brought a smile to her face. The songs of nearby birds seemed to speak to her and tell her what she should do. \\n  Carefully, Layla removed the geode from her pocket. As she held it, she felt the heaviness lift from inside her. She smiled when the sunlight bounced off the crystals, sending the rays in a thousand directions at once. \\\"You sure are pretty,\\\" she murmured. \\n  She was still smiling as she looked ahead at her classmates, who were down the trail with the tour guide.

Willie Bentley's happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.\n"," He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.\n"," When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.\n"," Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.\n"," When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. \"If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,\" he told his mother. Willie's mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.\n"," \"Fussing with snow is just foolishness,\" his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father's herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.\n"," Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! \"Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,\" he said.\n"," But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. \"Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,\" they said. \"We don't need pictures.\" Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.\n"," When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn't notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .\n"," But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.\n"," He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. \"You are doing great work,\" said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world's expert on snow, \"the Snowflake Man.\" But he never grew rich. He spent every penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. \"I can't afford to miss a single snowstorm,\" he told a friend. \"I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.\"\"\n","738\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<readability.scorers.flesch_kincaid.Result at

They had sent a remotely operated vehicle thousands of feet below the waves to take video of the deep sea. Dozens of team members were watching the live video feed from a ship on the ocean's surface and from offices on land. Suddenly, a mysterious creature appeared on their screens. It was a white, ghostlike octopod. That's a category of eight-armed ocean animals that includes the common octopus. But it did not look like any octopod the scientists had seen before.\\n  \\\"I was really excited because I recognized it was something unusual,\\\" says zoologist Michael Vecchione.\\n  Vecchione and the other scientists work for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The government agency was working on a project to map the ocean floor near Hawaii and study the ocean life there. The new octopod was an exciting\\u2014and unexpected\\u2014find.\\n \\n A Unique Species\\n  The newly discovered octopod has tiny eyes and a jelly-like body. It has very few muscles. That's because there is little food in the deep sea, and a lot of food is needed to build muscle. The creature also has some unusual characteristics that set it apart from other octopods. \\\"The first thing that makes it really unusual is that it doesn't have any chromatophores, or pigment cells,\\\" Vecchione told Scholastic Online. Pigment is what gives animals color. Because this creature has no pigment, it is very pale. It also has fewer rows of suckers on its arms than other octopods do. Suckers are body parts that octopods use to grasp objects. Those two characteristics lead scientists to believe that it is a completely new octopod species.\\n  The creature is also a record setter. It was spotted at about 14,000 feet\\u2014or 2.6 miles\\u2014beneath the waves. Some other types of octopods are known to live that deep in the ocean, but they all have fins on the sides of their bodies. The new creature belongs to a category of octopods that do not have fins. Until this discovery, no finless octopod had been found below about 13,000 feet.\\n \\n More to Discover\\n  Because of the octopod's ghostlike appearance, it has been given the nickname Casper. (Casper the Friendly Ghost was a popular character in an old cartoon.) But it cannot be officially named until scientists get a specimen to examine more closely. Unfortunately, that's not likely to happen anytime soon. \\n  \\\"The likelihood of encountering another one of these octopods is very small,\\\" Vecchione says. \\\"So it wouldn't be a very productive use of our time and resources to try to look for one.\\\" \\n  Still, the octopod's discovery is exciting because it suggests that many more undiscovered species could live in the deep sea and other places on Earth. \\\"It illustrates how little we know about life on our planet\\u2014and how much more we can find,\\\" Vecchione says.\\\"\",\n          \"\\\"The river wiggled \\n like a fat brown thread \\n along the flat quilt of the Red River Valley, \\n stitching North Dakota and Minnesota together.  My friend Sarah and I \\n ran races up and down the dike. \\n In winter, we walked across the river \\n to touch Minnesota. \\n In spring, we sat on her back porch  and watched the river ripple. \\n Sometimes, full of spring rain,\\n  it crawled up her yard,\\n leaving chunks of trees \\n that we made into pirate ships.  My brother, Max, fished on the river's banks. \\n Sometimes he let me carry his fishing pole and I sat beside him,\\n loving the wet, muddy smell of the summer river. \\n One time, Max caught the biggest fish any of us ever saw.  I ran and got the scale.\\n We weighed it \\n and Max kissed it\\n and then he threw it back. \\n That was us.  That was the river.\\\"\",\n          \" \\\"The following week the school board met to decide on the model for the new junior high school\\u2014which was probably why Mr. Kowalski had been spending all his time muttering \\\"classical, classical, classical.\\\" The meeting was to be at four o'clock in the high school administration building. Mr. Kowalski would present his plan and model, and then my father would present his plan and model, and then the school board would meet in private session to decide whether Kowalski and Associates or Hoodhood and Associates would be the architect for the new junior high school.\\n I know all of this because my father was making me come. It was time I started to learn the business, he said. I needed to see firsthand how competitive bidding worked. I needed to experience architectural presentations. I needed to see architecture as the blood sport that it truly was. . . .\\n The meeting was in the public conference room, and when I got there after school, the school board members were all sitting at the head table, studying the folders with architectural bids. Mr. Kowalski and my father were sitting at two of the high school desks\\u2014which made the whole thing seem a little weirder than it needed to be. In front of them was a long table with two models for the new junior high school, each one covered with a white sheet, like they were some sort of national secret. . . .\\n Mr. Kowalski picked up his presentation notes and angled out of his seat. He went up to the table with the models and stood there for a moment. Then he turned and looked at\\u2014no, not my father. At me! . . .\\n Mr. Kowalski cleared his throat. Twice. He looked at his design papers. He cleared his throat. Then he looked back at me once more, and began.\\n \\\"Gentlemen,\\\" he said, \\\"though this is irregular, I have made some significant changes for the interior of the new junior high since my original submission. In fact the entire concept has changed markedly. So the plans that you studied for this afternoon's presentation have also changed. I have copies of the new interior plan and ask the\\n What could the Chamber of Commerce Businessman of 1967 do? He shrugged and nodded. But the back of his neck grew as red as boiling sin, and I knew he did begrudge the extra time. He begrudged it a whole lot.\\n Mr. Kowalski pulled the sheet off his model of the junior high school. He cleared his throat again. \\\"As you can see, gentlemen,\\\" said Mr. Kowalski, \\\"the design is quite classical, in the best traditions of our national architecture, for a time when our children desperately need to be reminded of our great American traditions.\\\"\\n And it was. It looked like the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Wide steps swooped up past a line of pillars and up to the central doors. Above that rose a steep dome, with thin windows cut all around it. On either side of the dome, the building spread graceful wings\\u2014all with thin windows again\\u2014and behind, the long gymnasium formed the tail, whose rows of bright windows faced south and north to let in as much light as any gymnasium could ever have.\\n \\\"But we live in 1978, gentlemen,\\\" Mr. Kowalski said. \\\"Just as our children need to be reminded of our great traditions, so, too, do they need to enjoy the advantages of contemporary technology. I think you'll find the new interior design both modern and innovative, a perfect blend of where we have been and where we are going as a nation.\\\" He handed out copies of the plans for the new design to all the school board members, keeping his back to my father and me the whole time. Then he took us through the new interior. Slowly.\\n No pillars, no straight walls. The roof a series of glass plates above the science and art room. The central dome three stories high over the main lobby and clusters of classrooms all looking out into the sunlit space. All as modern as could be. . . .\\n The school board was astounded. Free of them applauded\\u2014not Mr. Bradbrook, since God doesn't applaud.\\n My father turned and looked at me again. His face was very red, and I could tell he was fighting for some kind of control. \\\"Holling, there's something you should have told me, isn't there?\\\" he whispered slowly. . . .\\n He used the kind of voice that, in my family, means that a voice a whole lot louder is about to come along in a minute or two, so you'd better start preparing.\\n But let me tell you, I didn't really care all that much about what he would say or how loudly he would say it. I really didn't. 16. Because suddenly I knew 16 new something a whole lot worse.\\n Romeo was a genius compared to me.\\n I hadn't seen at all what Meryl Lee was doing on Valentine's Day, while we were sipping sodas at the lunch counter at Woolworth's. I hadn't realized how easily she had gotten what she wanted from me: my father's design for the new junior high.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PassageWordCount\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 157.76661004769852,\n        \"min\": 257.0,\n        \"max\": 1029.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 73,\n        \"samples\": [\n          577.0,\n          792.0,\n          913.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PassageLexile\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 52,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"820L\",\n          \"660\",\n          \"910\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"PassageFK\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.9442839403898848,\n        \"min\": 2.0,\n        \"max\": 10.4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 52,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6.3,\n          9.3,\n          5.8\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BoxTextPassage\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 75,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"frivolity = carefree behavior; impelled = moved or driven into action\",\n          \"*Use \\\"Maple Street\\\" (p. 18) to answer questions 20\\u201323.
