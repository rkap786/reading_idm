2023-released-items-ela-g3,1,"""1. ""It's time to see how much you've grown since last year,"" Mom answered.
 
2. How could Trent and I have forgotten? Every year on our birthday Mom has us stand up straight against the bedroom doorjamb and she makes a mark to indicate how much we'd grown since the year before. My marks are in blue pencil crayon. Trent's are in red.
 
3. ""Do I have to right now, Mom?"" Trent pleaded. ""I want to get this aquarium ready for my new discus fish."" . . .
 
4. ""Come on now, it won't take long,"" Mom persisted. She held out a red pencil crayon and directed Trent to the door. ""Head and shoulders straight, back against the doorjamb. Let's go!""
 
5. In a hurry to get this over with, Trent trotted to the doorway and stood up against the jamb. He waited as Mom made sure he wasn't slouching or stretching and carefully marked the spot on the jamb where the top of his head reached.
 
6. ""Done?"" Trent asked.
 
7. Mom ignored him. ""Isn't that interesting,"" she said.
 
8. ""What?"" Dad inquired.
 
9. ""Yeah, what?"" Trent echoed.
 
10. ""Well,"" Mom smiled, ""your mark is higher than Troy's last mark. at's the first time that's ever happened.""
 
11. ""No way,"" Trent squealed with delight.
 
12. ""Take a look for yourself,"" Mom instructed.
 
13. I rushed over to the doorway and actually nudged Trent out of the way to get a better look. I couldn't believe my eyes. The red mark was indeed a little higher than the blue.
 
14. ""I'm taller than Troy!"" Trent celebrated. ""Awesome!""
 
15. ""You must have made a mistake,"" I protested to Mom. I could feel my stomach churning.
 
16. ""No, honey. I'm really careful with this."" Mom looked me in the eyes, patted my shoulder. ""Anyhow, there's very little difference."" . . .
 
17. ""Why don't the two of you stand back to back?"" Dad suggested. ""Then you'll see exactly who's taller."" Now Dad was really thinking.
 
18. ""Sure,"" I volunteered. I wanted to lay this matter to rest as soon as possible.
 
19. ""Sounds good to me,"" Trent echoed.
 
20. Trent and I turned and stepped backwards towards each other. We jostled a few seconds, adjusting ourselves to the tallest possible posture. His bony shoulder blades dug into my back. His long hair tickled my neck.
 
21. ""Well, what do you say?"" I asked.
 
22. ""Hold on,"" Dad answered. He had moved in close and was making sure neither of us were standing on our tiptoes or stretching our necks. His hands rested on each of our heads, keeping us in place. Meanwhile, Mom tilted her head to inspect us closely.
 
23. ""Well?"" I asked again.
 
24. Mom emitted a nervous little cough. ""I could be wrong, but . . .""
 
25. ""But what?"" I prodded.
 
-prodded = gently tried to get someone to do something-
 
26. ""I think Trent is just a smidgen taller."" She coughed again. ""Of course, that could be because he has more hair.""
 
27. Trent hurriedly lifted his hand to his head and patted down his hair. ""How about now?"" he asked.
 
28 ""Um . . ."" Mom stalled.
 
29. ""Dad?"" I pleaded. Standing tall, I kept my head forward and my back straight. I trusted his judgment.
 
30. ""Well, Troy, you may not like to hear this, but as far as I can tell Trent is in fact taller. Not by much, that's for sure, but there is a difference. Ninetenths of a centimeter, I'd say.""
 
31. ""Nine-tenths of a centimeter?"" I repeated.
 
32. ""Yes!"" Trent celebrated.
 
33. ""I can't believe this,"" I whined. ""There's just no way."" My mind raced. Something had to be wrong about this. Even Dad could make mistakes sometimes. ""Bring me a mirror,"" I demanded.
 
34. ""A mirror?"" Mom gasped.
 
35. ""Don't be ridiculous,"" Dad scoffed.
 
-scoffed = said in a way that did not show respect and seemed bothered-
 
36. ""Just bring me a mirror, please,"" I begged. ""Please!""
 
37. Mom shuffled off to her and Dad's room and came back with her make-up mirror, round-faced with a long handle, almost like the kind you see in old fairytale picture books. I grabbed it roughly and held it out to the side. Immediately Trent and I both turned our heads to see the evidence. It was tough to make out the difference between us, but there it was, reflected back at me, as undeniable as the pain that was settling right now into the pit of my stomach.

2019-released-items-ela-g4,1,"""1. ""No one but a man can do this,"" the business manager of the World, a New York newspaper, said to the young woman. The year was 1888. A popular book at the time told about a character who traveled around the world in 80 days. Now Nellie Bly, a young reporter for the newspaper, wanted to do it in real life.

2. ""Very well,' said Nellie. ""Start the man, and I'll start the same day for some other newspaper and beat him.""

3. In those days it was very unusual for a woman to travel alone. But Nellie Bly was an unusual woman. Her real name was Elizabeth Jane Cochran. When she was 20, she wrote a fiery letter to the editor of the Pittsburgh Dispatch. The editor was so impressed with her letter that he offered her a job as a writer.

4. It wasn't considered ""proper"" to use a woman's name in a newspaper. So the editor signed Elizabeth's work Nellie Bly, a name from a popular song.

5. Back then, women were only supposed to write about things considered to be ""women's topics,"" such as fashion and society. But Nellie had other ideas. She reported on issues that were important, even controversial. Newspaper readers were fascinated—but they didn't believe that Nellie Bly was really a woman. They thought men were writing the articles!

6. After Nellie threatened to make the trip for another newspaper, her editor gave in and allowed her to do it for the World. One year after asking to do the trip, Nellie set out. Traveling east across the Atlantic, Nellie took just one bag in order to move quickly. As she traveled, she wrote. She telegraphed her articles about people and places to the newspaper. Schoolchildren followed her route across Europe and Asia. Geography became a national fad as readers tracked her around the world.

7. On day 68 of her trip, Nellie reached San Francisco. Quickly, she dashed across the country on a train hired by her newspaper. She reached New York in 41/2 days.

8. She met her challenge! Along the way, every train stop was a ""maze of happy greetings, happy wishes, congratulating telegrams, fruit, flowers, loud cheers, wild hurrahs, rapid hand-shaking,' she wrote. While traveling through France, Nellie was thrilled to meet Jules Verne, author of the book that inspired her trip, Around the World in 80 Days.

9. Nellie Bly beat the 80-day goal. She also invented a new style of journalism. She reported to her readers what she saw, thought, and felt during her adventure. She also proved that a woman is as competent and resourceful as a man. Her journey around the world was a journey toward equal opportunity for both women and men.""",*Read this article.

2019-released-items-ela-g4,2,"""1. King Tiger thought he was the greatest tiger in the world. While I do not know if that was true, he was certainly the greediest. One day he said to himself, ""I wonder if there is tasty food nearby on the Island of Borneo.""

2. He called three of his strongest tigers and said to them, ""I have a job for you. You must swim to Borneo and ask their tiger king for food. Tell them the King of All Tigers demands it. If they don't agree, we will attack""

3. The King pulled out one of his large whiskers. ""Show him this and he will see what kind of tiger he is dealing with""

4. The three tigers swam over to Borneo, roaring all the way. Now, there were no tigers on Borneo, but all the animals hid when they heard the strange sounds and splashes. All except for Mouse Deer. He didn't hear them coming because he was busy eating his lunch of tender grass. Suddenly he looked up and saw three pairs of golden eyes staring at him.

5. ""Brave little morsel, isn't he?"" said one of the tigers. ""We have a message for your tiger king. Where is he?""

6. Mouse Deer thought, We have no tiger king. We have no tigers. But if I tell them that, I will be lunch for these tigers. I must think fast or, or... I will be lunch for these tigers.

7. He thought fast.

8. ""I can take your message to our tiger king,"" he said. ""But you look tired. Rest in the shade, and I will get him.""

9. ""Good idea,"" said the biggest tiger. ""Tell him that he must give us food, or we will attack. Show him King Tiger's whisker""

10. The whisker was so big it made Mouse Deer tremble. But he bravely hurried away with it in his mouth.

11. If I promise them food, they may eat me, he thought. What should I do?

12. He bounded on. Finally he had an idea. He found his friend Porcupine. ""Friend, the King of All Tigers wants to attack Borneo,' he said. ""He says we won't be able to fight him. Would you please let me have one of your quills?""

13. ""Gladly,' said Porcupine.

14. Mouse Deer waited awhile so that the tigers would think he had traveled far. When he came back they said, ""Well?""

15. ""O, Great Tigers,"" said Mouse Deer, ""when I reached our king he was sharpening his claws between two mountains. I gave him your message. He said, ""Good. It is too quiet around here. I'd be happy to fight that tiger. Send him over.' Then he pulled out one of his whiskers for you to give your king.""

16. The tigers were astonished. They had never seen a whisker as big and thick as that. They turned and left for their long swim back.

17. Mouse Deer pranced off on his tiny hoofs.

18. As soon as the tigers reached their island, they went to the King of All Tigers.

19. ""What took you so long?"" he roared.

20. ""Well,"" one tiger said, ""the King of Borneo looks forward to fighting the King of All Tigers. He sends his whisker.""

21. The King stared at it for a while. Then he spoke, ""I have been thinking while you were gone. We should demand food from the Island of the Elephants instead of the Island of Borneo.""

22. And that is why, even today, there are no tigers on Borneo. There are plenty of mouse deer, but no tigers.""",*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 19 through 24*.,"*Mouse Deer and the Tigers*

2019-released-items-ela-g5,1,"""1. In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley's happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.

2. He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.

3. When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.

4. Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.

5. When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. ""If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,"" he told his mother. Willie's mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.

6. ""Fussing with snow is just foolishness,"" his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father's herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.

7. Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! ""Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,"" he said.

8. But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. ""Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,"" they said. ""We don't need pictures."" Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.

9. When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn't notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds. . . .

10. But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.

11. He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. ""You are doing great work,"" said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world's expert on snow, ""the Snowflake Man."" But he never grew rich. He spent every penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. ""I can't afford to miss a single snowstorm,"" he told a friend. ""I never know when I will find some wonderful prize.""""",*Directions. Read this article. Then answer questions 8 through 14.*,*Excerpt from Snowflake Bentley* _by Jacqueline Briggs Martin_,8,"1.

2019-released-items-ela-g5,2,"""1. In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley. To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned. . . .

2. When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish's house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.

3. One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish's mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him. . . .

4. Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, ""This one will make her owner rich!"" Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. ""If she will make me rich,"" said Gregor, ""how is it that she has not done so for you?""

5. The man paused, thinking. ""I have not had her long enough!""

6. ""Nonsense,"" said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.

7. When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. ""My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!""

8. ""Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.""

9. She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.

10. ""Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,"" said Gregor. . . .

11. One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, well-dressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!

12. Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. ""I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,"" said MacTavish, opening his sporran. ""I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see."" MacTavish sneered at Gregor.

13. Gregor hugged Dear One. ""I will not sell her to you!""

14. At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. ""I will pay anything,"" he said. ""Name the price.""

15. Gregor was ready. ""That,"" he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. ""I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed.""

16. ""Done,"" said MacTavish.

17. The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.

18. After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish's riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.

19. ""I have been cheated!"" shouted MacTavish.

20. ""You have not been cheated,"" said Gregor. ""I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn't she?""

21. ""Yes, but . . . ,"" sputtered MacTavish.

22. ""Then you got what you paid for."" Gregor turned and walked away.

23. Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.""",*Directions Read this story.

2019-released-items-ela-g5,3,"""1. ""Come,"" Wangari's mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves. 

2. ""Feel,"" her mother whispered.

3. Wangari spread her small hands over the tree's trunk. She smoothed her fingers over the rough bark.

4. ""This is the _mugumo_,"" her mother said. ""It is home to many. It feeds many too.""

5. She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.

6. ""Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree's shade,"" her mother explained.

7. Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother's spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree. . . .

8. When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley's ridge. She was scared.

9. ""Go,"" her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter's hand. ""Where you go, we go."" . . .

10. As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.

11. ""Not many native women become biologists,"" they told her.

12. ""I will,"" she said.

13. Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood. . . .
14. When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the _mugumo_ trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.

15. Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.

16. ""We must do something,"" Wangari said.

17. Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. _""Harabee!_ Let's work together!"" she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. ""We must plant trees."" . . .

18. Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.

19. ""We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,"" she said.

20. One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.

21. Mothers fed their children maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes until they could eat no more.""

2018-released-items-ela-g6,1,"""1. I sat in my pink-flowered swimsuit on the hot concrete of the driveway, my legs stretched out in front of me, my chipped pink toenails pointing to the sky. I was reflecting on the brilliant defeat the boys had just suffered in yet another water fight with the neighborhood girls.

2. Looking down the driveway to the road, I felt the ground beneath me rumble. My legs began to shake, the leaves on the trees trembled, and I could swear that a flowerpot tumbled over on my neighbor's front porch. The intense rattling increased with every passing second.

3. I got up and started to run, my bare feet smacking against the scalding pavement. I had to hide until I found an excuse. Something, anything, to get me out of it.

4. ""Paige,"" I heard my mom call from the front door, ""come inside. Your grandparents just pulled up""

5. ""Rats,"" I whispered. Slowly, I turned around and walked back with my head down, looking at the pavement.

6. When I got to my driveway, I looked up and saw the familiar sight. It was a monster, a big white monster, complete with an ""I Love Fishing"" bumper sticker. The shadow it made almost covered the entire driveway. But the real problem sat behind the white monster. It looked harmless at first, but I had already spent too many boring afternoons in it this summer. It was a little red fishing boat, my grandpa and grandma's pride and joy.

7. I walked inside the house where my grandparents and my mom were standing around the island in the kitchen. I gave both of my grandparents a hug and proceeded to the cupboard for a glass.

8. ""How ‘bout some fishing, Paige?"" my grandpa asked. ""Your two brothers are raring to go?

9. This is what I'd been dreading. ""I don't know, Grandpa. It's pretty hot out""

10. ""It's never too hot to fish. I brought the boat and everything. It's all hitched up behind the RV. I know how much you love riding in the boat.""

11. He was wrong. I hated that boat. I liked riding in boats when they were going fast. I liked riding in boats that I could water-ski behind. I'd even settle for tubing if skiing wasn't an option. But fishing boats hardly even moved.

12. ""We'll have to buy you a new fishing pole first. Your mom said you lost your last one,"" said Grandpa.

13. I seemed to lose a lot of fishing poles, but my grandpa never minded. He would just take me to Target to buy another one.

14. In twenty minutes, I found myself walking into the mouth of the monster, complete with pink interior from the dirt-covered floor mats to the darker pink seats. Behind the seats nestled a small kitchenette, littered with what was surely last month's breakfast: two plates covered with syrup, an old waffle box, an empty carton of eggs, and a basket filled with rotten fruit. Across from the kitchenette stood the bathroom, which contributed to the monster's bad case of morning breath. Beyond this was a small bed, piled high with pink blankets, resembling a tongue that could lash out at any time and swallow me whole.

15. Hanging neatly on hooks above the kitchenette counter were Grandpa's hats, white with stains, like teeth that hadn't been brushed in a while. They all had sayings like ""#1 Grandpa"" and ""King of the Sea."" Before he sat down in the driver's seat, Grandpa plucked the nearest hat off a hook and put it on over his bald spot to avoid burning his head in the hot summer sun.

16. My grandpa maneuvered the large RV and boat out of our neighborhood, and in ten minutes, we were at Raccoon River, placing the red fishing boat in the water. I was going to borrow an extra pole that my grandpa kept ""just in case"" Great.

17. In minutes, all three of us kids had our lines in the water. The sweat running down my body was already stinging my eyes and turning the fake leather seat beneath me into a wet, slippery mess. The breeze that may have made the summer heat bearable was nonexistent on the small lake surrounded by tall trees. It was going to be a long afternoon.

18. Three hours later, everybody else had caught at least two fish. The boat was once again attached to the back of the RV, and we were on our way home, a waste of another Saturday afternoon.

19. ""Wasn't that fun, kids?"" asked my grandpa as he peeked back at us through the rearview mirror.

20. My brothers both responded enthusiastically and then began arguing about who had caught the biggest fish. I continued to stare out of the RV window without answering Grandpa's question.""",*Directions. Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 7.*,*Excerpt from Last Regrets* _by Paige Hook_,1,1.

2018-released-items-ela-g6,2,"""1. We had to board a second plane, smaller and bumpier than the last, which carried us south, along the western coast of the country. My heartbeat quickened as I peered out the window, down through the clouds at the blue waves tossing and turning below us. My first glimpse of the ocean.

2. ""Your grandmother will be so pleased to see you, Rakhee. Do you remember her— your Muthashi?"" Amma asked over the whir of the engine.

3. I did remember Muthashi, my grandmother. She had come to stay with us in Minnesota when I was around three or four. I could not recall the exact details of her face, but I had a vague mental picture of a slight woman draped in white who used to sit me on her knee and sing a song in Malayalam about ants.

4. I used to run out onto the driveway humming the ant song, and guide a string of the black insects into my palm. Weaving my fingers together and making a delicate cup with my hands, I would transport them into the house, giggling as the ants tickled inside their little cage. Muthashi would always act so pleased when I proudly deposited the squirming ants into her outstretched hand, although I'm sure she would let them out the back door as soon as I wasn't looking.

5. ""Rakhee,' continued Amma. ""I haven't told you much about our family, have I?""

6. I shook my head.

7. ""Well, the Varmas are the most prominent, respected family in the village. My father was a doctor, and he started a hospital across the street from our home. He died a long time ago, so now my younger brother, Vijay, is in charge. You'll also meet my big sister, Sadhana, and her three daughters. One of them is about your age. And Vijay' s wife, Nalini, who I have never met, recently had a baby boy. Everybody lives together at Ashoka—that's the name of the house where I grew up. You see, in India families stick together under one roof. It's not the same as it is in America""

8. This airport was not as crowded or chaotic as the one in Bombay, and the people seemed neater and more subdued. In the bathroom Amma changed into a buttercup-yellow sari and painted a red raindrop on her forehead^1 with a bottle that she produced from her purse. ""I can't show up at home dressed like an American,' she explained.

9. I loved seeing that transformation, from my regular mother who took the trash out every morning with a bulky coat flung over her nightgown to this wondrous creature. From the moment she put on the sari and released her hair from its bun so that it streamed down her back in a lustrous river, she appeared younger and somehow more natural.

10. ""How do I look?"" she asked, as she ran a comb through her hair.

11. ""You look beautiful, Amma,"" I told her honestly.

12. A compact man with a bushy mustache and a symmetrical crescent of sweat under each arm met us outside the airport, holding a sign with ""Mrs. Chitra Varma Singh and daughter"" printed across it in block letters. He led us through the thick heat toward a white car and loaded all our suitcases into the trunk. Amma and I both slid into the backseat. My legs stuck to the synthetic leather.

13. ""Are you hungry, molay?"" Amma asked me. ""We'll be home soon? But she sounded absent, as if my hunger was hardly her main concern.

14. I stared out the window as we drove. Unlike the gray, arrow-straight highways I was accustomed to, here the roads were red and twisty. In the distance I could see groves of coconut trees, their green fronds waving against the sky like pinwheels. We passed forests of rubber trees and stretches of lime-green grassland that Amma told me were rice paddy fields. Wiry, mustachioed men with protruding rib cages spiraling down their torsos and white cloths knotted around their waists (""Those cloths are called mundus,' explained Amma) were scattered here and there in the treetops, tapping the trunks and collecting sap in metal buckets.

15. At one point the driver stopped the car abruptly. I leaned over the seat and was shocked to see a cow blinking her long black lashes at me. The driver honked the horn and she took her sweet time ambling out of the way.

16. Soon after, I heard a dull thud and a hulking elephant rounded the corner, heading toward us, the tough black ripples of its trunk swaying to and fro.

17. ""Amma!"" I cried.

18. But Amma only laughed. ""It's normal for elephants to walk around on the street here, don't worry.'

19. A man wearing a faded blue turban and carrying a gnarled stick was riding atop the great animal. I waited for either the turbaned man to steer his charge out of the way or for the car to slow down, but neither thing happened. The driver pushed forward with alarming speed, straight toward the elephant. I gasped, but at the last second he swerved, and both he and the man nodded politely to one another, as if this were perfectly normal. The elephant lumbered past the car window so close that I could have reached out and brushed my fingers against its sagging hide.""

2018-released-items-ela-g6,3,"""1. The only difference between a lightning bolt and the small spark that jumps between your hand and a metal doorknob after you scuff across a rug is size. Both happen when electrical charge builds up and suddenly discharges.
 
What Is Lightning?
 
2. Lightning begins inside thunderstorms. Updrafts of air lift raindrops from the bottom of the cloud into freezing air at the top. Downdrafts move ice particles lower, into warmer air. Negatively charged electrons build upon the falling ice as it passes the water droplets. In time, the storm cloud becomes negatively charged on the bottom and positively charged on top.
 
3. When the negative charge builds up enough, a huge number of electrons jump through the air, looking for something that conducts electricity: the ground, a tree, a lightning rod. We see that discharge as a flash of lightning.
 
4. Lightning zips along at 40 miles (64 kilometers) a second. The center of the lightning bolt is only about as thick as a pencil, but it packs so much energy that it can melt rock or metal and set wood ablaze. An average lightning bolt has enough electricity to run the appliances in your house for a couple of days. But all that electricity arrives at once, at 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit (30,000 Celsius)—six times hotter than the surface of the sun. It would melt anything you tried to use to collect it.
 
 5. Thunder is the sound of lightning. Each bolt super heats the air around it to 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (9,980 Celsius) in less than a second. The superhot air instantly expands, sending out a shock wave that we hear as thunder. The farther away lightning strikes, the deeper the sound of the thunder—and the longer it takes to get to you. That's because light travels much faster than sound. In fact, if you count the delay between the lightning and the thunder, you can tell approximately how far away the lightning is (about a mile for every five seconds).
 
*Lightening around the world*
 
6. Between 1,500 and 2,000 thunderstorms are crackling and booming around the world at this very moment—scientists estimate that lightning strikes somewhere on Earth about 100 times every second. Where does it strike the most often? Lightning zaps the remote mountain village of Kifuka, in central Africa, nearly every day. There, air masses from the Atlantic Ocean collide with cooler mountain air, making lots of thunderstorms. The Himalayas are another lightning hotspot. In the United States, the best place to spot lightning is Florida. Warm air from the Gulf of Mexico banging into cool air from the Atlantic Ocean creates lightning almost daily across the Sunshine State.
 
7. Places with very stable weather get the least lightning. The Arctic and Antarctica have almost no thunderstorms because their air is about the same temperature everywhere. Lightning is also uncommon far out over the ocean, away from land, for the same reason. 
 
*Lightening Safety*

8. Because of its unpredictability and power, lightning can be extremely dangerous. If you're caught outside during a lightning storm, don't stand under a tree or lie flat in the open. Instead, crouch down with your hands and your head tucked close (but not touching the ground) and your feet close together. This makes you less of a conductor for any bolts that strike near you. Rubber-soled shoes are no protection—if lightning can zap through miles of air, which is an excellent insulator, your favorite trainersThe wont stop it either.
 
 9. If you can, try to get inside a car or building. You're safe inside the car because electricity will travel over the metal surface instead of through the interior. In buildings, stay away from metal faucets and telephones connected to the wall—lightning can travel through pipes and wires. Then, once you're safe inside, look out and enjoy the awesome beauty of Earth's electricity!""",*Directions. Read this article.

2018-released-items-ela-g8,1,"""1.""September is like a quiet day after a whole week of wind. I mean real wind that blows dirt into your eyes and hair and between your teeth and roars in your ears after you've gone inside. The harvesting is done and the wheat stored away and you're through worrying about hail or drought or grasshoppers. The fields have a tired peaceful look, the way I imagine a mother feels when she's had her baby and is just lying there thinking about it and feeling pleased.

2. It was hot, though, like a flash-back to July. I was glad we weren't cooking for harvest hands. There wasn't any fire in the stove and everything was spick-and-span because I had just washed the dinner dishes. Mom was out having another look for the turkeys that were always wandering off. Dad was lying on the couch in the other room waiting for the noon broadcast of wheat prices to come on. We had to sell our wheat this month and not hold it over; that is, we did if I was going to the university that fall. It might go higher along toward Christmas, but we couldn't wait for that.

3. The house was so quiet I could hear Mom calling the turkeys down by the barn. Dad told Mom not to bother, they'd come back by themselves, but Mom worried if anything was lost or left unlocked.

4. ""When I've got something, I take care of it,"" she always said.

5. I washed some cucumbers while I was waiting. They were bright green and shiny in the water. I used to play they were alligators when I was a child. Then I fenced them in with my hand and poured off the water into the kettle on the stove. When you have to carry every drop of water you use half a mile, you don't throw away any.

6. And then it began. I knew before Dad turned it up. The voice of the man who announces the wheat prices is as familiar to me as Dad's. It's different from anybody's voice around Gotham—more like one of those city voices that broadcasts the war news. That voice touches us here, and all the ranches spread out over the prairies between the Rockies and the Mississippi. It touches all the people in Clark City, thirty miles from here, who live on the ranchersTh1, even though they try to forget it.

7. ""Here is your Grain Market Broadcast for today: Spring and Winter . . . up two.""

8. I could add two to yesterday's price, so I didn't have to hear any more, but I listened out of habit and because I love to hear it.

9. ""One heavy dark Northern Spring . . . fifty-two."" The words came so fast they seemed to roll downhill. Nobody ever calls it all that; it's just spring wheat, but I like the words. They heap up and make a picture of a spring that's slow to come, when the ground stays frozen late into March and the air is raw, and the skies are sulky and dark. The ""Northern"" makes me feel how close we are to the Rockies and how high up on the map, almost to Canada.

10. ""One dark hard Winter . . . fifty-three""

11. It's just winter wheat to the people who raise it, only to me it means more than that. It means all the winter and all the cold and the tight feeling of the house in winter, but the rich secret feeling I have, too, of treasure in the ground, growing there for us, waiting for the cold to be over to push up strong and green. They sound like grim words without any comfort to them, but they have a kind of strength all their own.

12. ""Durum, Flax, and Rye... up one."" The broadcast ran on. Mom came in while I was standing there listening.

13. ""Wheat's up,' I told her.

14. Mom nodded. She stood there untying her bandanna and I watched her as though I didn't know her face better than my own. Moms is a quiet face with a broader forehead than mine and dark brows and eyes and a wide mouth. She doesn't show in her face what she thinks or feels—that's why people in Gotham think she's hard to know—but when she laughs, the laughter goes deeper down in her eyes than anybody's I know.

15. I look more like Dad. He is tall and thin and has light hair and blue eyes and his face shows what he thinks or feels. Mom is square and stocky with broad shoulders and hips. It's just as well that I am more like Dad in my body. I like being slender and straight. I am strong like Mom, though, and I like working in the fields better than in the house.

16. Dad clicked off the radio and came out to the kitchen. ""Well, we'll go over and tell Bailey we're going to sell. Fifty-three is good enough. Come on, Ellen, you can drive me over.""

17. I took off my apron and was running across to the barn for the pickup before Dad had taken his hat from behind the door. I felt so excited I couldn't walk soberly.

18. Glory, it was hot! I had the doors of the truck tied open with a piece of rope so the air could rush through, but it felt hot enough to scorch my bare ankles, and the heat of the engine came up through the rubber soles of my sneakers.

19. You can't see the elevatorTh2 till you get past our place. There's only one in Gotham, but it stands up from the crossroads like a monument. That and the railroad station are the only things to let people know Gotham's a town.

20. ""I feel I'm going for sure, Dad,"" I told him.

21. ""You bet you're going,"" Dad answered. ""The war spoiled college for me, all but one year. Nothing's going to spoil it for you.""",*Directions. Read this story.

2018-released-items-ela-g8,2,"""1. All the children in Aberdeen knew the tall, dapper gentleman who strolled through town each day. For a child on the Dakota Plains, life in the late 1880s sometimes seemed little more than hard work. The bleakness of the prairie cried out for a fantasy to take a boy or girl far away. Mr. Baum's stories were pure fantasy, so when he walked down the street in his finely tailored suit, children clamored in his wake.

2. Unlike stories told by parents, Baum's were not merely lectures in disguise. Instead, he made everyday objects—scarecrows, pumpkins, rag dolls—come alive. His stories glittered with color; whole fields were shaded blue, green or red. As he went on, Baum often seemed to lose himself in the telling. Years later, his mother-in-law, who had overheard many of his stories, urged Baum to write them down. But while living in Aberdeen, he was content to tell his tales just to please a child or two.

3. When Lyman Frank Baum finally did set pencil to paper, stories poured out of him. In a career of just two decades, he wrote more than 70 books. Many are long forgotten, but one was called The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It's about a girl from Kansas who meets a scarecrow, a tin woodman and a cowardly—well, perhaps you know the story. But you may not know that Oz is more than a single book that inspired one of Hollywood's greatest movies. Long before TV staked its claim to children's fantasies, Oz was mapped in the imaginations of countless children. Going on beyond the wizard, Baum wrote 13 other Oz books. After he died, his successors churned out 26 more. Between 1913 and 1942, a new Oz book came out every Christmas. Oz Reading Clubs devoured each one. An Oz Who's Who charted the kingdom's colorful characters, including the Patchwork Girl, the Tik-Tok Man, Princess Ozma and hundreds more. These days, the ubiquitous^1 MGM movie overshadows the books, but readers who choose to go there still find Oz so much more than lions, tigers and bears, oh my. Baum's fairyland is a place of childish dreams and fears, a kingdom ruled by love but haunted by fear of sudden death. It's a land where adults are as helpless as children and children are as strong as adults. Peppered with puns and wordplay, Oz is charming and altogether ambivalent about the benefits of age. In short, it's much like its creator, L. Frank Baum, the ""Royal Historian of Oz""

4. The seventh child born to Benjamin and Cynthia Baum came not trailing clouds of glory but clouds of gloom. In 1856, Frank was born. From an early age, he seems to have suffered from angina pectoris, a heart disease causing severe chest pain. Baum's delicate condition made him a sedentary, solitary child. He read constantly, mostly fairy tales. For most of his youth, he was schooled at home. While Frank was still very young, his father developed some oil fields in Pennsylvania and made a fortune. The Baums moved to a mansion, called Rose Lawn, where Frank flourished.

5. At 18, he began hanging around some nearby theaters and decided he wanted to become an actor. His father tried to steer his stagestruck son from his dream but finally relented, asking only that Frank not disgrace the family name. Going by various stage names, Baum moved to New York City to begin his acting career.

6. No road to success was ever more winding than Baum'. He followed the stage from job to job and state to state. Actors must moonlight, so Baum worked as a newspaper reporter, a dry goods salesman and finally as a playwright. His only hit, under the name Louis FE. Baum, was an Irish melodrama called The Maid of Arran. Baum wrote and starred in the play that opened on his 26th birthday. The tall, mustachioed gentleman with the smiling eyes seemed on his way; so successful was he that he could even consider marriage.

7. According to the family legend, it was love at first sight. Maud Gage was a sophomore at Cornell University. On introducing him to Maud, his aunt said, ""I'm sure you will love her"" Baum smiled and replied, ""Consider yourself loved, Miss Gage."" Maud held out her hand and answered, ""Thank you, Mr. Baum. That's a promise. Please see that you live up to it."" He did. Married the next year, Frank and Maud Baum remained as devoted as any fairy tale couple. But Maud soon found that her husband often resided in a world entirely of his own.

8. Around the time of his marriage in 1882, Baum suffered a series of setbacks in business and health. To add to his burdens, his family's money had been lost. Maud's sisters and her brother had recently moved to the Dakota Territory, and their letters told of fortunes to be made. So in 1888, with his life on the downward side of the rainbow, Baum moved his family west to the prairie.

9. What is now Aberdeen, South Dakota, was then a boomtown of 3,000. Baum decided the town needed an upscale store and started Baum's Bazaar. The bazaar broke even for a while, but when the Dakota boom ended, the store went belly-up.

10. Broke and far from home, Baum fell back on old friends—his fantasies. The stories he told children on Aberdeen's dusty sidewalk spoke of a better land where goodness prevailed, love triumphed and no one was hungry or poor. Yet Baum was still required to make a living in this world, so he moved the family to Chicago in 1891.

11. For a time, he edited his own magazine promoting store window displays, but of more importance to children, he finally began to write down his stories. In 1897, his first successful book, Mother Goose in Prose, was published. His next book, Father Goose, His Book, became the nation's best-selling children's title. After decades of dead ends, Baum had finally found his road.""",*Directions. Read this article. Then answer questions 8 through 14.*,*Excerpt from The Amazing Author of Oz*  _by Bruce Watson_,8,"1.

2018-released-items-ela-g8,3,"""1. More than ever, Eliza wants to win. She wants to win with a word so difficult her father will have to admit that he was wrong, that the letters are already guiding her.

2. When Number 127 is being asked to spell LOQUAT, Eliza closes her eyes and feels her mind empty out. L fills her head, a glowing yellow the color of molten metal. _This is what Dad meant._ She's surprised at how easy it is. Inside Elly's head, L grows longer, its edges curving inward to form an O. Her body loosens. When the edge of O grows a tail to become Q, Eliza feels the change in her fingertips. Q's top evaporates and its tail disappears, U settling warm in her belly. Elly feels a tickle as U flips and grows a line through its middle to become an A. When Ass legs slide together as its arm floats up T fills Eliza, straightening her spine. Eliza opens her eyes. She feels as if she has just woken from a deep sleep. Number 127 is walking offstage to the sound of vigorous applause.

3. ""I did it?' she mouths to her father across the room.

4. Saul smiles and nods. ""I love you too,"" he mouths back equally indecipherably.

5. By Round 7, there are seventeen of them. Number 14, whose perpetually perfect posture adds to the overall impression that he is an android, causes murmurs of admiration when he rips through DVANDVA without asking for a derivation or use in a sentence. When Number 22 gets her word wrong, No Chin has to pry her hand from the microphone. Number 33 decides midway through PERIPATETIC that he has made a mistake. He turns stubbornly silent, demanding to be dinged out rather than made to complete the word. He stands mute until his time runs out. The judge's spelling reveals that the boy's progress had been perfect until he had refused to go on.

6. Number 36 is called to the mike. Rachel almost trips on her way to the front of the stage, removes the microphone from its stand, and holds it to her mouth like a lounge singer. The Independence Ballroom suddenly seethes with the sound of her nervous breathing.

7. ""Number 36, your word is GREGARINE""

8. Having been informed that a gregarine is a parasitic protozoan taken from the Latin, Rachel has no choice but to start spelling. She pounds her palm against her forehead after each letter, as if trying to knock the next one loose. Because she is holding the microphone so close to her face, each moment of contact sounds like a heavy blow.

9. ""..I.."" Pound."" ..N…"" Pound. ""..E..."" Pound. ""Gregarine""

10. Eliza finds herself bracing for the next blow, but none comes. The judge's ""Correct"" sends Rachel leaping back to her seat to resume picking at her placard, which is now noticeably smaller than the others.

11. When Number 41 is given PURIM Eliza almost laughs out loud. Then she realizes that such an easy word right before her turn is a bad sign, almost certain to mean she's destined to get something awful. Number 41, the only contestant wearing a yarmulke, makes short work of PURIM and returns to his seat with a dazed grin. The judge calls Eliza to the mike.

12. As she stands, Elly hazily recalls her nightmare: the expectant silence, the feeling she is holding up time, the endless path from her seat to the microphone. She decides that if she can get this next word, whatever it may be, her chances of winning are practically guaranteed. From the moment she rises from her chair, she locks eyes with Saul, whose gaze practically steers her to the microphone.

13. ""Number 59, your word is DUVETYN""

14. ""Dew-veh-teen?"" Eliza's heart lurches into her throat. In her mind's eye, she sees nothing.

15. ""That is correct. Duvetyn.""

16. Saul is staring so hard it feels like he's directly in front of her instead of halfway across the room. She wants to ask him to leave, to just get on the plane and fly back home.

17. ""Um, what does it mean?""

18. The judge's voice is irritatingly friendly. ""Duvetyn is a soft, short-napped fabric with a twill weave, made of wool, cotton, rayon, or silk""

19. Eliza whispers the word, feels the way it shapes her tongue and lips. From these movements she tries to chart the word's path through time and place. Where has it traveled? When was it born?

20. ""What is the derivation, please?""

21. The judge's voice is ever neutral, revealing nothing. ""Duvetyn comes to us from the French""

22. Eliza wants to see herself through the judge's eyes. Does he have favorites? Is she one of them? Or are they interchangeable, one long blur of nervous hands and voices? Her placard suddenly reminds her of the stickers affixed to new underwear: INSPECTED BY 59.

23. She's got to focus. There isn't much time. She returns to Duvetyn, pushes everything else aside.

24. I know it starts with D.

25. ""Dew-veh-teen""""

26. At first it is a struggle to empty her mind which keeps conjuring up fresh images: her father's face, a conveyer belt laden with tagged children, but eventually all is black and blank. D, D, D, D, D, D, Eliza thinks until D, proud and foreboding appears in her mind's eye. Then, its top disappears. The letters are showing her the way.

27. ""D-U..""

28. Dew-veh- teen. She speeds through the next few letters, which are obvious.

29. "".. V-E-T…"" and now she's got the word in her head, letters rearranging themselves into something that looks right, something French.

30. ""..I-N-E. Duvetine."" It feels good. 
31. Time moves so slowly. The silence lasts so long Eliza is sure it means she is correct. Her heart begins to pound faster. Walter Cronkite and the loving cup are practically hers.

2018-released-items-ela-g3,1,"""1. Parrots that are trained to talk often say silly things like ""Polly want a cracker."" Although these birds have learned to imitate the sounds that make up the words, they don't really know what they're saying. But there is one parrot who speaks more than a hundred words and actually understands their meanings. He is an African gray parrot named Alex.
 
 2. Dr. Irene Pepperberg, a research scientist, has worked with Alex for many years. Teaching Alex to speak and understand wasn't easy at first. He had to learn one word at a time. Irene and an assistant would teach Alex by showing him what a word meant. Irene would hold up an object, saying, ""What's this?"" Her human partner would give the word—""pasta,"" for example—while Alex watched. Irene would praise her partner, then ask Alex the name of the object. When he got it right, Irene would praise him and give him the object to play with as a reward. It took Alex many weeks to learn his first word. After that, each new word became easier and easier for him.
 
 3. Why did Irene spend so much time getting a parrot to talk? Scientists like Irene are interested in discovering how intelligent animals are and how their brains work. But studying animal intelligence has always been difficult, partly because animals haven't been able to communicate clearly with humans. Teaching Alex to speak words that he understands has let Irene talk to him directly. She can ask him questions, and he can answer them in English. In this way, Irene is finding out what sorts of things Alex's brain can do. She has found that parrots are much smarter than scientists used to think. The word ""birdbrain,"" which means someone who isn't very smart, certainly doesn't apply to Alex.
 
 4. Alex can identify over forty kinds of objects, five different shapes, five materials, and seven colors, and he can use his knowledge to solve problems and answer questions. For example, from a group of objects, he can pick out a number of things of a certain color, up to the number six. He can also make comparisons, such as bigger or smaller and same or different, between objects.
 
 5. ""Want wheat!"" Alex says loudly. Irene explains to him that she doesn't have any shredded wheat for him. ""How about some crackers, Alex?"" she asks.
 
 6. ""No, no—want wheat!"" he replies.
 
 7. Because it's time for them to work, Irene tray with simple objects scattered over it: a square, a five-cornered piece of yellow felt, paper triangle, a red plastic square, and a blue Play-Doh square.
 
 8. ""What material is green, Alex?"" Irene asks.
 
 9. Alex glances over the assortment, then answers, croaky parrot voice.
 
 10. ""Good birdie,"" says Irene as she nuzzles Alex nibbles at it for a moment, then he drops it.
 
 11. ""How many yellow?"" asks Irene.
 
 12. Alex takes his time looking over the bright, colorful display on the tray.
 
 13. ""Three,"" he answers.
 
 14. Irene praises him again. ""Good boy, good the yellow key to play with.
 
 15. Alex mouths the key, nibbling at it gently before dropping it.
 
 16. ""Wanna go shoulder,"" he announces.
 
 17. ""O.K., you can come onto my shoulder,"" answers Irene. She puts out her hand. Alex climbs aboard, and she puts him on her shoulder. He rubs his head against Irenes cheek. ""Do you want some corn?"" asks Irene.
 
 18. ""Soft corn,"" answers Alex, and Irene holds out her hand with a few kernels on it. Alex carefully takes one kernel into his mouth and eats.
 
 19. Alex has shown us that birds like parrots can understand categories such as shape, color, and size. They can solve problems and recognize numbers. Before Alex came along, scientists did not believe that animals with such small brains could do these things.
 
 20. Alex uses his ability to talk outside of work sessions, too. At the end of the day, Irene tells Alex she is leaving.
 
 21. ""I'm going to dinner now,"" she says. ""You be good.""
 
 22. ""You be good,"" Alex answers.
 
 23. ""See you tomorrow,"" says Irene.
 
 24. ""Bye,"" says Alex.
 
 25. ""Bye,"" she responds.
 
 26. ""I love you,"" croaks Alex.
 
 27. Irene's last words as she goes out the door are ""I love you, too."" """,*Directions Read this Passage. Then answer questions 1 through 6.*,"*Alex, the Talking Parrot*

2018-released-items-ela-g3,2,"""1. ""Oh, no!"" said Stella, as the string of her shark kite tangled with the string of a biplane kite. The biplane dove toward the ground, the grinning shark spiraling behind it. ""I feel like a spider in a web,"" she said, frowning as the tangled strings drifted down around her.
 
 2. ""I think that shark kite has too many strings,"" said the owner of the biplane kite, as he untangled his string from Stellas.
 
 3. ""My kite doesn't have too many strings,"" said Stella. ""It's a grownup's kite. That's why it's complicated to fly.""
 
 4. ""You should really try flying a paper plate,"" said Stella's friend Robby. Stella looked at Robby's kite. He had decorated a plate with stickers and a long yellow streamer and attached a string to it. Right now, his paper plate was flying so high that Stella could hardly see it.
 
 5. ""Your shark kite hasn't flown as high as my paper plate all day,"" said Robby, wiping his nose on his sleeve.
 
 6. ""Paper plates are for babies,"" said Stella. She felt like being mean, because her shark kite could hardly fly.
 
 7. Just then Stella noticed a fluffy pink jellyfish kite sailing overhead, bobbing a little as it passed Robby's paper plate. Stella wished she could trade her shark for that jellyfish.
 
 8. Stella wound the string of her fallen kite around its spool. Then, holding the string near the shark's belly, she started running. If she could catch a tiny breeze, her kite would fly.
 
 9. ""Stella, it's almost time to go!"" called Stella's mother from a park bench in the shade. ""We have to pick up your sister at the pool.""
 
 10. ""Come on, shark, fly!"" Stella said as she tossed the kite into a little puff of wind. For a moment, the shark looked as if it was swimming up into the sky. Then, it dove back toward the grass, teeth and all.
 
 11. ""Maybe it's too heavy,"" said Robby. He tugged lightly on the string of his paper plate, which dipped gently in the air.
 
 12. ""It's not heavier than that one,"" said Stella. She pointed at an enormous monster truck kite gliding past Robby's paper plate. The monster truck had big black wings. ""I bet that kite weighs more than you do, Robby,"" said Stella.
 
 13. Robby squinted at the sky. ""No, it doesn't. I weigh forty pounds,"" he said.
 
 14 .""Stella, your sister is waiting,"" her mother called again.
 
 15. ""One more try, Mom,"" yelled Stella, running with the shark. This time, the shark kept its nose pointed downward the whole time, refusing to fly at all. Stella tripped over the shark's fin and fell into the dirt.
 
 16.""Come on, brush yourself off, Stella,"" said her mother. ""We're leaving.""
 
 17. ""You can take my paper plate if you want,"" said Robby. ""At least you'll get to fly something today."" He looked at Stella hopefully.
 
 18. Stella sighed. Robby's paper plate was nothing like the fancy shark she had imagined flying. But it did fly pretty high.
 
 19. ""O.K.,"" Stella agreed with a shrug. She took Robby's string and felt the strong, steady pull of the kite dancing at its end. She gave a slight tug. The paper plate swirled and floated even higher on the breeze. Stella smiled at Robby. ""You're right,"" she said. ""Paper plates do make good kites.""
 
 20. ""You can keep it,"" said Robby. ""I'll make another one next weekend.""
 
 21. ""Want to borrow the shark, then?"" asked Stella, handing the tangle of strings and the grinning shark to Robby. ""Maybe you can make it fly.""
 
 22. ""Hey, thanks,"" he said. ""See you next weekend, Stella.""
 
 23. Stella and her mother walked toward the car. Stella held the string of her new kite, and the paper plate sailed along above them, its yellow streamer wriggling through the air.
 
 24. ""What happened to your shark kite?"" asked Stella's mother.
 
 25. ""Robby and I swapped for a while,"" Stella replied.
 
 26. As Stella rode in the car, she held on to the paper plate's string and watched it bob next to her window. ""I bet that big old shark couldn't do this!"" she laughed.""",*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 19 through 24.*,"*The Shark Kite*

""1. ""The snow leopard is rarely seen by humans. This mysterious cat lives in 12 Asian countries among the worlds tallest mountains.
 
2. The snow leopard is smaller than the tiger, the lion, and the leopard of Africa and Asia. It weighs as much as a cheetah, but is shorter and stockier. The cat's compact shape and thick fur help keep it warm in glacier-chilled air. Dark markings dapple its light-gray coat, camouflaging it in rocky terrain. Big paws make padding over snow easier. An extra-long tail provides balance on steep, rugged ground. 
 
3. You might think the snow leopard would be safe living in such harsh, remote places. But it faces multiple threats from humans. The cat has lost important stretches of habitat. (A habitat is the place that fills an animal's needs—mainly food, shelter, and mates.) Mining, wars, and overgrazing by farm animals have all led to this loss of habitat.

*Protecting the Herd*   

4. The loss of habitat has caused a food shortage. Snow leopards eat wild goats and sheep. When farm animals eat too much vegetation, wild plant eaters can't find enough food to stay healthy. Females don't have enough babies. Over time, the numbers of wild goats and sheep go down, and snow leopards have less to eat. Then the big cats eat livestock, and the herders kill the leopards to protect their livelihoods.
 
5. Agencies are working to save the cats and help herders at the same time. Some agencies give herders wire mesh and wood to keep snow leopards from entering their stables at night. Some pay herders for the animals they lose to snow leopards. In exchange, the herders stop killing snow leopards and leave more room and plants for the wild goats and sheep.
 
6. Are the conservation programs working? Researchers estimate that only 3,500 to 7,500 snow leopards are alive today. But they need more reliable ways to count leopards before they will know.
 
7. That's where scientists like Dr. Kyle McCarthy are needed. He traveled to Kyrgyzstan to test ways of estimating snow leopard numbers. He camped in the mountains with Dr. Jennifer McCarthy (his wife) and other co-workers. They saw no leopards, but they hadn't expected to. Instead, they looked for evidence the cats left behind. ""You have to find something related to them: poops, scrapes (claw marks), and pee,"" Dr. Kyle McCarthy says.
 
8. The group collected scat (poop) for DNA analysis. Along with the waste material of digestion, scat contains cells from the animal's own body. DNA is material inside those cells that, like fingerprints, can identify an individual animal.
 
9. The team also used automatic cameras. The scientists placed motion-andheat- sensitive cameras along a mountain ridge. When a snow leopard neared one of these ""camera traps,"" the camera snapped its picture.
 
10. Each snow leopard's spot pattern is different. Researchers compared patterns in the photos to identify cats. The cameras had taken photos of 15 different snow leopards at two study sites.

*A Close Encounter*

11. Shannon Kachel, Dr. Kyle McCarthy's graduate assistant, has searched for snow leopards in Tajikistan, where he almost saw one. ""I was hiking along a ridgeline in the late afternoon and came around the corner of a rock outcropping to find a steaming, fresh kill site with snow leopard signs all round,"" Kachel says. ""I could see and hear where the cat had knocked some rocks loose as it ran away from me, but even though I waited until it was nearly dark, I never saw the cat.""

12. ""Most people will never see a snow leopard, yet it has a right to exist,"" Dr. Kyle McCarthy says. ""It's too magnificent to think about losing.""",*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 7 through 12.*,"*Saving Snow Leopards*

She moved as gracefully as the brolgas, the tall, slender cranes that courted along the riverbank. The people in the camp would often see Kanikiya dancing down by the water, for she wore a scarlet ribbon around her neck, and it floated as she moved. People believed she danced like moonlight shining on the running river.

2. Dancing was fine for a young child, but by the time she was twelve, the people in the camp did not approve of such frivolity in a young woman. She should be working, they insisted. Only the youngest children danced away the day.

3. Kanikiya's mother, hearing disapproval around the camp, warned her that she must stop dancing. ""Remember the story of the lazy girl who would not work,"" she said. ""She turned into a dingo. The rest of her life she ran with packs of wild dogs, preying on sheep at night.""

4. Kanikiya, who knew the camp legends, shivered at her mother's words. Such tales frightened her. But she knew she wasn't lazy. It wasn't laziness that made her forget her work. The need to dance surged through her. She could not stop dancing any more than she could stop breathing. She feared that if she stopped doing either, she would die.""
""5. Flocks of silvery gray brolgas stopped near Kanikiyas camp during their migration in the spring and fall of each year. Then, more than any other time, Kanikiya would forget her work, steal to the river, and watch the birds dance as the day darkened. As if impelled by a strong, mysterious force, Kanikiya would join in their dance at the rivers edge, her scarlet ribbon flying behind her. If only I could dance with the cranes all my life, thought Kanikiya as she trudged back to the camp, then I would be at peace. One spring evening Kanikiyas mother found her daughter dancing near the river before she had finished gathering cabbage palms for their evening meal.

6. ""I can do nothing with you, Kanikiya!"" her mother shouted. ""I have decided. You must not leave the camp until the brolgas have left. I feel they have powers over you that must be broken."" While her m other spoke, Kanikiya felt tears gather. She sensed the eyes of the brolgas upon her. Glancing up, she marveled as they dipped their heads and danced a slow, m ournful dance. They understand my sorrow, Kanikiya thought, the knowledge warming her.

7. Her m other grabbed her arm, pulling her toward the camp. Within Kanikiyas heart something died as she left the river that evening. Plodding up the bank, she felt her life begin to ebb away. The next day, instead of going out to gather food, Kanikiya stayed in the camp. She wove baskets from the reeds the other children collected. Day followed day in a mournful blur. She couldn't eat. She wouldn't smile. The heaviness in her heart grew, and because of that she became weaker. As she worked, she listened to the happy calls of the brolgas and imagined herself dancing with them, twirling, dipping, and free. At night she danced with the birds in her dreams.

8. If only I could dance with them again, she'd think each morning upon waking, then I would find rest for my soul. Soon the call of the brolgas became too strong for Kanikiya to deny. One morning before dawn she heard them calling her. Slipping out of the camp, she rushed down to the riverbank to dance with the cranes.""

""9. Just this one time, she thought as she whirled, her scarlet ribbon floating behind her. Just this once, then peace will visit me again. Later that morning, she was not found at her weaving. Her m other looked for her throughout the camp and, not finding her there, searched near the river.

10. As Kanikiyas m other neared the water, she found dozens of wild brolgas dancing and dipping to the sound of the wind in the trees. Fearful of their savage dance, she turned to go. But before she started up the path, she noticed one graceful crane in the center of the flock, a scarlet ribbon tied around her neck, dipping her head in greeting"".""","*Directions Read this story.

2019-released-items-ela-g3,1,"""1. ""Craig watched his older sister, Riley, and her friend Liz race up and down the lake on their skates, dodging the other hockey players. Their skate blades looked like silver smoke.

2. When the game was over, the girls skated up to the bench where Craig was sitting. Craig asked Riley what skating felt like.

3. ""When I go really fast, I feel like I'm flying,"" she said.

4. That's silly, thought Craig. Flying is something birds do in the air, not something people do on ice skates. Then he watched Riley go back out on the ice. She skated around and around the edge of the lake with her arms pumping and her scarf trailing behind her. Soon she was going so fast that her arms looked like wings and her scarf looked like a feathery tail. Maybe skating really was like flying.

5. When Riley sat down to take her skates off, Craig said, ""I wish I could fly.""

6. Riley retied her skate laces and crouched next to Craig. ""Get on my back,"" she said, and Craig did. Riley started skating, but Craig didn't feel like he was flying. It just felt like a wobbly piggy-back ride.

7. ""You're too heavy,"" Riley said. ""I can't go fast when I'm carrying you"" She skated slowly back to the bench. Craig got off her back.

8. ""Even if you could go fast, I wouldn't be flying,"" he said sadly. ""I need skates to fly.""

9. Riley didn't say anything on the walk home, but a few days later she asked Craig if he wanted to go skating.

10. ""To watch?"" he asked.

11. ""No, to skate,"" she said cheerfully. ""Mom and I found a pair of my old skates. They might fit you""

12. The skates were a little big, but when Riley stuffed newspaper in the toes, they fit. Craig couldn't stop smiling. He didn't want to take them off, but he had to so he could walk to the lake.

13. Riley and Liz went with him. They carried their hockey sticks, two orange cones, and a wooden chair. When they got to the lake, Craig put his skates back on and Riley helped him onto the ice. Then she put his hands on the back of the chair.

14. ""Hang on to this and you won't fall,"" she said. ""Just push it along in front of you, OK?""

15. Craig grinned. ""OK."" His feet felt wobbly, but he held on to the chair and he didn't fall. Riley and Liz cheered him on as he started to move forward. Then they set up the cones and practiced passing the puck to each other and shooting goals.

16. Craig watched them. They made skating look easy. He tried to skate like them, but when he let go of the chair he fell. So he grabbed on to it again and inched along. His skate blades went scritch scritch scritch instead of the swish swish sound that his sister's blades made. This wasn't like flying at all. It was like being a snail.

17. ""Ready to go home?"" Riley finally asked.

18. Craig nodded, frowning. Riley had never said how hard skating was.

19. ""What's wrong?"" she asked.

20. ""I wanted to skate like you,"" Craig said. ""I wanted to fly.""

21. ""Someday you will,"" Riley said. ""It takes practice."" She patted his shoulder. Then she whispered something to Liz, who grinned and winked at Craig. Each girl took one of Craig's hands.

22. ""Someday you'll fly on your own,"" Riley said. ""But today Liz and I will help you.""

23. Riley and Liz started skating, pulling Craig with them. The edges of his skate blades just touched the ice. The girls went faster and faster, and so did he. When he looked down, his skate blades were a silver blur. His hat nearly blew off.

24. ""I'm flying!"" he yelled, and the words blew away in the wind like a bird's happy song.""",*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 6.*,"*Flying on Ice*

2. Crash! Thunder shakes our roofs and windows. A lightning storm dazzles the sky like flickering fireworks.

*Lightning Begins*

3. High above the ground, water droplets and ice crystals swirl and swarm inside the moving clouds. The tiny particles bump into one another. When the particles rush together, they become charged. Electricity is created.
 
*Lightning is Electricity*

4. A single stroke of lightning carries millions of volts of electricity. Each stroke heats the air in its path to as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,760 degrees Celsius). That is five times as hot as the surface of the sun.""

""*Thunder and Lightning*

5. The heat from lightning makes the air expand quickly. Expanding air makes a booming, bursting sound like a firecracker. This is the sound of thunder. Thunder and lightning happen at the same time. Light travels faster than sound. This is why we often see the flash before we hear the boom.

*How Far Lightning Travels*

6. Lightning can flash faster than you can blink. During a single flash, lightning can streak down to the ground and back up to the clouds. A lightning stroke that flashes down to earth can stretch up to nine miles (14 kilometers). That's taller than the world's highest mountain. Lightning flashes from cloud to cloud can travel even longer distances.

7. Ribbon lightning darts from the sky. It looks like jagged streaks side by side. Forked lightning looks like an upside-down tree. The branches of electricity reach through the clouds. Sheet lightning streaks inside a cloud. The cloud lights up like a bright, white sheet. Heat lightning happens during the hot summer. It looks like faraway flashes in the sky. Heat lightning is too far away for its thunder to be heard.

*Lightning Around the World*

8. Every day, lightning flashes from thousands of thunderstorms around the world. Every second, more than 100 lightning bolts hit the ground. Lightning can strike a tree or dry grass. When this happens, a wildfire can start. Lightning bolts can hit tall buildings. They also can hit electrical towers, houses, and cars.

9. Flash! Lightning is streaking through the clouds. Every flash is another display of nature's fireworks.

*Fast Facts*

10. It does not have to be raining outside for lightning to strike. Lightning can strike both before and after the rain falls, or even when there is no rain at all. Lightning helps nature by putting nitrogen into the ground and air. Nitrogen is a nutrient. That means it feeds plants and helps them grow.

*Safety Tips*

11. Windows, water faucets, pipes, telephones, and electrical outlets can be dangerous when there is lightning in the sky. You should not run water or talk on the phone if you see lightning. You could get an electrical shock.

12. Benjamin Franklin once flew a kite in a lightning storm. That is how he learned about electricity. But today, we know lightning is very dangerous. If you see lightning, you should go indoors right away.""",*Directions Read this passage. Then answer questions 7 through 12.*,"*Excerpt from Nature's Fireworks: A Book About Lightning*

2019-released-items-ela-g7,1,"""1. ""William hoped that life could now return to normal. He'd worked hard to pass the exams to enter high school. When the term began, however, William's father explained that, because of the drought, there was no money to pay his school fees. It appeared that William's education would end at eighth grade.

2. Though he could not attend school, William still wanted to learn. He was curious about many things. He took apart radios, trying to discover how they made music. One day, turning a bicycle upside down and cranking the pedals by hand, he figured out that the dynamo that generated electricity for the headlight could be wired to power a radio instead. He asked how gasoline made cars run and how CDs stored songs. No one knew, or even cared much about his questions.

3. Some days, William visited the village library. It had only three shelves, but William found books that interested him—science books about how things worked. William would check out Explaining Physics or Integrated Science, plop under a mango tree, and pore over the drawings and diagrams inside. Since his English was not very good, he often looked up words in the dictionary or asked the librarian. He wondered if something in these books might be useful to his family.

4. One day, while looking for a dictionary on the bottom shelf, he found a book he hadn't seen before pushed behind the others. It was an American school textbook called Using Energy. On the book's cover was a picture of a row of windmills, tall steel towers with blades spinning like giant fans. They reminded William of the toy pinwheels he'd made with his friends.

5. From this book William learned that wind—something of which Malawi had plenty—could produce electricity. William was delighted! Only two percent of the houses in Malawi have electricity. After the sun sets, everyone stops what they're doing, brushes their teeth, and goes to sleep—at seven in the evening! If William could build a windmill, his family could have lights in their home. And a windmill could be used to pump water to irrigate the family's maize fields. If another drought came, the windmill could provide the water for life.

6. William could picture in his mind the windmill he wanted to build, but collecting the parts and tools he needed would take months. In a junkyard across from the high school, William dug through piles of twisted metal, rusted cars, and worn-out tractors, searching for anything that might help him construct his machine. He took a ring of ball bearings from an old peanut grinder and the cooling fan from a tractor engine. Cracking open a shock absorber, he removed the steel piston inside. He made fourfoot- long blades from plastic pipe, which he melted over a fire, flattened out, and stiffened with bamboo poles.

7. Earning some money loading logs into a truck, he paid a welder to attach the piston to the pedal sprocket of an old bicycle frame. This would be the axle of the windmill. When the wind blew, the rotating blades would turn the bicycle wheel, like someone pedaling, and spin a small dynamo. Although he had no money for a dynamo, a friend came to the rescue and bought one from a man in the road, right off his bike.

8. Village kids laughed at William when they saw him scrounging in the scrap yard. They called him misala, which means crazy. But William was too focused on his idea to care.

9. When he had collected all the parts, William took them out of the corner of his bedroom, laid them outside in the shade of an acacia tree, and began putting them together. Since he did not have a drill to make bolt holes, he shoved a nail through a maize cob, heated it in the fire, then pushed its point through the plastic blades. He bolted the blades to the tractor fan, using washers he'd made from bottle caps. Next he pushed the fan onto the piston welded to the bicycle frame. With the help of his two best friends, William built a 16-foot-tall tower from trunks of blue gum trees and hoisted the ninety-pound windmill to the top.

10. Shoppers, farmers, and traders could see William's tower from the local market. They came in a long line to find out what the ""crazy"" boy was up to. ""What is it?"" they all asked.

11. Since there is no word for ""windmill"" in Chichewa, the language of Malawi, William answered with the phrase magetsi a mphepo—""electric wind."" From the top of the tower he explained that, by using the power of wind, his machine could create electricity. No one believed him.

12. William knew this was his moment—his moment to show everyone he wasn't crazy, to find out if his experiment would work. He connected two wires from the dynamo to a light socket he'd made from a reed and that held a small bulb. As the wind whipped around him, he removed the bent spoke he'd jammed into the wheel to lock it. Then he held his breath. . . .

13. the blades began to turn, slowly at first, then faster and faster. The light bulb flickered, then flashed to life. The crowd cheered from below. ""Wachitabwina! Well done!""

14. A month later William found enough wire to reach from the windmill into his house. His family crowded around to marvel as the small bulb lit up in William's room. Reading Explaining Physics by its light, he stayed up long after others had gone to bed.

15. In 2006, a school inspector saw the windmill and informed his head office. William's machine now powered four lights and two radios in his house. He'd added a storage battery with homemade switches and a circuit breaker. He also recharged village cell phones.

16. Soon William was being interviewed on the radio and photographed for the newspapers. The story of the boy with only an eighth-grade education who'd built ""electric wind"" spread across the Internet.""15.

""The following week the school board met to decide on the model for the new junior high school—which was probably why Mr. Kowalski had been spending all his time muttering ""classical, classical, classical."" The meeting was to be at four o'clock in the high school administration building. Mr. Kowalski would present his plan and model, and then my father would present his plan and model, and then the school board would meet in private session to decide whether Kowalski and Associates or Hoodhood and Associates would be the architect for the new junior high school.

2. I know all of this because my father was making me come. It was time I started to learn the business, he said. I needed to see firsthand how competitive bidding worked. I needed to experience architectural presentations. I needed to see architecture as the blood sport that it truly was. . . .

3. The meeting was in the public conference room, and when I got there after school, the school board members were all sitting at the head table, studying the folders with architectural bids. Mr. Kowalski and my father were sitting at two of the high school desks—which made the whole thing seem a little weirder than it needed to be. In front of them was a long table with two models for the new junior high school, each one covered with a white sheet, like they were some sort of national secret. . . .

4. Mr. Kowalski picked up his presentation notes and angled out of his seat. He went up to the table with the models and stood there for a moment. Then he turned and looked at—no, not my father. At me! . . .

5. Mr. Kowalski cleared his throat. Twice. He looked at his design papers. He cleared his throat. Then he looked back at me once more, and began.

6. ""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""though this is irregular, I have made some significant changes for the interior of the new junior high since my original submission. In fact the entire concept has changed markedly. So the plans that you studied for this afternoon's presentation have also changed. I have copies of the new interior plan and ask the

7. What could the Chamber of Commerce Businessman of 1967 do? He shrugged and nodded. But the back of his neck grew as red as boiling sin, and I knew he did begrudge the extra time. He begrudged it a whole lot.

8. Mr. Kowalski pulled the sheet off his model of the junior high school. He cleared his throat again. ""As you can see, gentlemen,"" said Mr. Kowalski, ""the design is quite classical, in the best traditions of our national architecture, for a time when our children desperately need to be reminded of our great American traditions.""

9. And it was. It looked like the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Wide steps swooped up past a line of pillars and up to the central doors. Above that rose a steep dome, with thin windows cut all around it. On either side of the dome, the building spread graceful wings—all with thin windows again—and behind, the long gymnasium formed the tail, whose rows of bright windows faced south and north to let in as much light as any gymnasium could ever have.

10. ""But we live in 1978, gentlemen,"" Mr. Kowalski said. ""Just as our children need to be reminded of our great traditions, so, too, do they need to enjoy the advantages of contemporary technology. I think you'll find the new interior design both modern and innovative, a perfect blend of where we have been and where we are going as a nation."" He handed out copies of the plans for the new design to all the school board members, keeping his back to my father and me the whole time. Then he took us through the new interior. Slowly.

11. No pillars, no straight walls. The roof a series of glass plates above the science and art room. The central dome three stories high over the main lobby and clusters of classrooms all looking out into the sunlit space. All as modern as could be. . . .

12. The school board was astounded. Free of them applauded—not Mr. Bradbrook, since God doesn't applaud.

13. My father turned and looked at me again. His face was very red, and I could tell he was fighting for some kind of control. ""Holling, there's something you should have told me, isn't there?"" he whispered slowly. . . .

14. He used the kind of voice that, in my family, means that a voice a whole lot louder is about to come along in a minute or two, so you'd better start preparing.

15. But let me tell you, I didn't really care all that much about what he would say or how loudly he would say it. I really didn't. 16. Because suddenly I knew 16 new something a whole lot worse.

17. Romeo was a genius compared to me.

2019-released-items-ela-g7,3,"""1. ""A huge lake hides miles below the ice sheet that covers most of Antarctica. That's big news for anyone interested in Earth. But scientists who look beyond our planet are excited too. Astronomers see signs of thick sheets of ice covering large bodies of liquid water in other places in our solar system.

2. This unseen world on our own planet could help scientists search for life beyond Earth. This possibility makes Antarctica one of the most valuable environments on Earth. At least, that's how scientists view it now.

 *Unlikely in the Extreme*

3. For a long time, most scientists didn't think liquid water could exist under Antarctica's ice cover. Water freezes at 32°F/0°C. A research station called Vostok is located on top of a thick Antarctic ice sheet. Scientists there once recorded the surface temperature as –128.6°F/–89°C.

4. In the 1950s, Andrei Kapitsa, a Russian scientist working at Vostok, noticed something strange. A formation of very flat ice stretched over the research area. He believed it was a clue suggesting a body of liquid water existed below the ice.

5. Then, in the 1970s, planes equipped with more advanced equipment offered new
information. As part of a mapping project, pilots used ground-penetrating radar over the Vostok station. The data suggested the planes were flying over water. Even then, scientists did not fully realize that an amazing liquid world was hidden beneath the ice. Finally, in 1996, satellite technology revealed the shape of a huge subglacial lake.

6. Lake Vostok is about 140 miles (225 kilometers) long. It is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide and the water in the lake reaches as much as 2,625 feet (800 meters) deep. Such an immense size makes this lake one of the largest in the world. What had seemed impossible turned out to be true.
 
*Signs of Life?*

7. In addition to Lake Vostok, scientists found a huge system of rivers and almost 400 lakes hidden below the Antarctic ice. This could be the largest wetland in the world, as much as one and a half times the size of the United States.

8. While some scientists mapped out these hidden lakes on Earth, others were discovering ice-covered environments elsewhere in the solar system. During the 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft flew by the planet Jupiter and its moons. It sent back photographs suggesting that an ocean exists below the surface of the ice-covered moon called Europa.

9. As time went on, more research provided new possibilities. Other moons of Jupiter and Saturn seemed to be worlds where thick, icy shells surround large bodies of liquid water.

10. Could life exist in such an extreme environment? It certainly seems unlikely. As with the discovery of Lake Vostok, the clues for scientists seeking life pointed in ""unlikely"" directions. Most life on Earth depends on sunlight. How could sunlight penetrate an ice cover thousands of feet deep? Living things also depend on nutrients to grow. Where would these come from? Scientists wondered how nutrients could enter a system that has been cut off from the world above for millions of years. What's more, they knew that any kind of life in this extreme environment would have to survive tons and tons of pressure from the ice above.

11. Yet, in the deep ocean, some life forms exist without sunlight. Their nutrients come from the chemicals that rise through the ocean floor from deep inside the Earth. These creatures have developed qualities that allow them to thrive under the weight of tons of water.

12. Could living things with similar abilities exist in Antarctica's subglacial wetland? If they do, life might also be possible in the icy moons of the outer solar system.

*Looking for Proof*

13. First, scientists needed to obtain and test water samples from Antarctica's hidden world. It was easier said than done. Antarctica's extreme cold and short summer season permits only a few months of research each year. Even then, drilling into the ice posed another big problem.
 
14. Drilling technology uses chemicals like kerosene and Freon to help melt the ice, make a borehole, and keep it open. If the drill penetrated the lake, the chemicals could contaminate the water. This process could also introduce microbes from the surface into water that had been isolated from the rest of the world for millions of years.

15. Scientists had been drilling into the ice above Lake Vostok long before its discovery. The ice cores they obtained helped them study a record of Antarctica's climate going back hundreds of thousands of years. Ice just above the lake showed signs of microscopic life. It was a clue but it was not proof.
 
16. A research team penetrated Lake Vostok in 2012. They used chemicals to melt the ice and to keep the borehole open. However, they believed they did not contaminate the lake because water rushed into the borehole and froze. The team removed the ice core to study it. However, many other scientists questioned this method.

17. In 2013, Lake Whillans, located in a different area of Antarctica, became the first subglacial lake where clean technology helped scientists obtain a water sample. Hot water and ultraviolet light helped sterilize the drills and equipment. Scientists wore sterile clothing so that they did not contaminate any water samples.

18. They found almost 4,000 types of microbes not only surviving but also thriving in Lake Whillans. Some seem to feed on the chemicals found in solid matter, called sediment, at the bottom of the lake. Others use the dead bodies of other microbes as food.

19. So far, scientists have found only single-celled microbes living in the few places where they have tested the subglacial water. More research and testing may help them discover if larger life forms survive in this extreme environment.""",*Directions Read this article.

2018-released-items-ela-g7,1,"""1. You've got to get an early start tomorrow, but you're not sleepy yet. Blame your brain, at least in part.
 
2. Yet that same brain is still under construction. And much of that important work takes place on the night shift—while you sleep. Here's what's happening—and why it matters.
     
*Hello, Night Owl!*

3. Today's lifestyle is one reason for late bedtimes. Many teens don't finish with after- school activities, part-time jobs, dinner, chores, and homework until 10 p.m. or later.
 Add in some time for relaxing, and bedtime may not roll around until 11 p.m. or nearly midnight.
 
4. Those ""relaxing"" activities can actually delay sleep longer. Screens for television, games, computers, tablets, e-readers, and cell phones give off blue light. ""The brain reads that as daylight,"" says Kyla Wahlstrom, an expert on education and sleep at the University of Minnesota.
 
5. In response, the brain cuts back melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep, explains public health professor Lauren Hale at Stony Brook University. Plus, time is limited. ""If you're doing more screen time, you're getting less sleep time,"" she says.
 
6. ""There are emotions involved in going online,"" Hale adds. Falling asleep can be harder if texts, chat, social media, or even sports reports excite or upset you. Caffeine from sodas and energy drinks makes matters worse.
 
7. Even without modern technology, though, teens shift their circadian rhythm. That's the daily cycle for sleeping, waking, and various other activities. In particular, the brain's pineal gland starts releasing melatonin later. That's the ""sleepy"" hormone.
 
8. Teens' time shift is a little like the jet lag you'd feel traveling from New York to Colorado. Until your body adjusts, you'd stay up later despite the time change. But teens' brains stay in that later time zone.
    
*Sleep Deprivation*

9. The rest of the world doesn't shift, however. So most teens must head to school before they've gotten the 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). And that's a serious public health problem.
 
10. For one thing, lack of sleep makes it harder to pay attention. When studies compared teens who had earlier and later school start times, they found that those who had more time to sleep did better in class. They also suffered fewer accidents in sports, driving, and other activities.
 
11. Adequate sleep is important for learning too. ""Basically at night the sleep processes all your information from the previous day,"" says Wahlstrom. She compares it to cleaning up a computer's hard drive.
 
12. Lack of sleep could hurt mental health. Studies have found an inverse correlationTh1 between teens' amount of sleep and depression and other mental illnesses. As sleep time went down, the risks for the mental illnesses went up.
 
13. Beyond that, sleep-deprived teens report more relationship problems and feelings of inadequacy. ""They just get overwhelmed,"" Wahlstrom says.
 
14. Having sleep cut short could curb the brain's processing of emotions from the previous day. For some reason, Wahlstrom says, ""The negative stuff hangs on longer."" Crankiness can result, especially if you don't feel well.
 
15. Other studies suggest sleep-deprived teens get sick more often. ""Our immune system is negatively affected by inadequate sleep,"" notes psychologist and academic affairs vice president Amy Wolfson at Loyola University Maryland.
 
16. Weight control suffers from too little sleep too. ""Hormonally, your body is saying eat more, eat more,' "" explains Hale. And because lack of sleep lowers impulse control, you're more likely to grab chocolate cake than celery.
 
17. ""You don't just think better and act better"" when you get enough sleep, adds psychiatry professor Mary Carskadon at Brown University. ""You look better."" One study found that the more sleep people got, the more likely people were to find them attractive.
    
 *Under Construction*

18. Just as importantly, burning the midnight oil can interfere with brain development. When teens hit puberty, the number of long brain waves drops during non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep.
 
19. Neuroscientists Ian Campbell and Irwin Feinberg at the University of California,
Davis, suggest the drop shows that the brain is pruning unnecessary connections between nerve cells. The brain loses some plasticity—the ability to adapt in response to injury or other big changes. But the process lets the brain mature. ""It will streamline your brain—make it a more efficient adult brain,"" explains Campbell.
 
20. Lots of issues remain for sleep researchers to explore. For now, though, studies are clear: Teens' brains need sleep!
 
21. In August 2014, the AAP urged high schools nationwide to delay start times to at least 8:30 a.m. Later starts can let teens get a bit more sleep when their brains really want it. Unfortunately, not all schools can or will heed that advice. And you can't easily change your body's natural circadian rhythm.""",*Directions Read this article.

2018-released-items-ela-g7,2,"""1. When Ohkwa'ri came that evening to sit by the central hearth in the Turtle Clan's section of the big longhouse, his uncle suspected that his nephew had something important to ask. So Big Tree continued to work in silence, giving his nephew plenty of time to collect his thoughts. It was fully dark outside now, and Grandmother Moon was looking down through the smoke hole overhead.
 
 2. Big Tree picked up a burning coal from the fire with his fingers, lifted it unhurriedly, and dropped it into the wooden cup that he was making from a piece of hard maple. He had been working on that cup for two moons and it was almost finished.
 
 3. Ohkwa'ri watched carefully. He remembered two winters ago when he tried to pick up a coal as his uncle did, but only succeeded in blistering his finger-tips. Big Tree's fingers were tougher than Ohkwa'ri's, the callouses on them so thick that the glowing coal did not burn them.
 
 4. It will be many seasons, Ohkwa'ri thought, before I can do the things that my uncle can do.
 
 5. Big Tree placed the glowing coal into the bowl of the cup and nodded to his nephew. Ohkwa'ri leaned forward. This job was one that he could do now. He could help his uncle finish hollowing the bowl by blowing on the coal through the thin hollow branch of a sumac. Ohkwa'ri blew and the coal burned with a sound like that of a tiny storm wind, reddening the blackened wood, burning the hollow deeper. He moved the sumac branch as he blew steadily, puffing his cheeks in and out as he blew, making sure that the coal moved around the bowl evenly to make the inner shape of the cup just right.His uncle raised a hand and Ohkwa'ri stopped blowing. The coal, which had been the size of the end of his thumb, was now a tiny spark. Big Tree took his sharp-edged scraping stone and used it to clean out the bowl.
 
 6. ""This is good,"" his uncle said. ""Now I only have to smooth the inside and this cup will be ready to use.""
 
 7. He held it up and both he and Ohkwa'ri admired it. The finely detailed handle was the long head of a bear. Big Tree had used his sharp flint knife to finish off the details of the bear's head at the front of the cup, even making marks that looked like the fur of the bear. Then he had blackened it in the fire to harden and darken it and make it look even more like a bear.
 
 8. ""Who will be the owner of this cup, my uncle?"" Ohkwa'ri asked.
 
 9. ""A man who needs it,"" his uncle replied with a smile.
 
 10. Ohkwa'ri nodded. Every man owned a cup such as that, usually with some design on it which indicated his clan. Your cup, which would be hung from your belt, could be used for dipping up drinking water when you were in the forest.
 
 11. Dipping water with a cup was a wise idea, for you could remain watchful and alert while doing this. If you had to lean down and drink with your mouth from the spring or the stream, an enemy or a dangerous animal could creep up unseen. You also could thrust the cup deep under the surface where the water was cleaner and colder. Then, when you were back in the longhouse, you could use your cup to dip soup from the pot when the food was ready and your hunger told you to eat.
 
 12. Ohkwa'ri already had a cup of his own, a small one made of soft basswood that hung on his belt. But that cup was plain and chipped and it was not well carved. It was a boy's cup. It was useful, but it was better to have something that was useful and beautiful.
 
 13. Ohkwa'ri put the sumac blowpipe back on the shelf above his uncle's bed. Like all things that would be useful to more than one person, it was kept in plain sight. That way, if anyone in the village had need of it they could simply take it and return it when they were done. Truly personal things—like Ohkwa'ri's stone with its two beautiful crystals—were kept out of sight in the bark boxes under everyone's beds. No one would ever look under another person's bed.
 
 14. Ohkwa'ri came and sat back down by his uncle, who continued to work on smoothing the inside of the cup.
 
 15. ""Uncle,"" Ohkwa'ri said, ""I think it is time for me to build a lodge.""
 
 16. Big Tree continued to work on the cup without saying anything in response.
 
 17. ""I do not mean that I think it is time for me to move away from my mother's hearth,"" Ohkwa'ri said. ""I know that it is still two or three winters before it will be time for me to do that, to go and live on my own. But I think that it would be good for me to make a little lodge and sleep in it some nights. It would be a good way to learn, a good way to make myself tougher and stronger.""
 
 18. Ohkwa'ri's words were true. In another few winters he would be expected to move out of the longhouse, to no longer live near his mother. Then he would need to know how to care for himself. Every boy came to this time in his life when he was expected to go through a whole year of the hard training needed to be accepted fully as a man. He would find a place outside the village and build his own lodge, sleeping there every night. Although he could still return to the big longhouse and take meals with his family, he would truly be responsible for himself.""","*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 22 through 28.*

2018-released-items-ela-g7,3,"""1. Laboulaye felt a ""genuine flow of sympathy"" between France and the United States and described the countries as ""two sisters."" Aware that the hundredth anniversary of the colonists' independence was just eleven years away, Laboulaye hoped to give the United States a special hundredth birthday present on behalf of France.
 
2. He decided that the gift should be a monument honoring liberty. Laboulaye
explained that this monument would have a dual purpose. It would reinforce France's bond with America. In addition, the gift would stress to Napoleon Ill's regime that the French people were dedicated to the concept of liberty and equality.

      *BARTHOLDFS CREATION*

3. Bartholdi wrote that the seed for the Statue of Liberty was sown at the party that night. It is generally thought that Laboulaye's opinion influenced Bartholdi, who began thinking along the same lines. Nevertheless, actual plans for the monument did not begin for years. In July 1870, France declared war on Germany and the Franco- Prussian War began. Bartholdi served in the French Army, and art took a backseat as the sculptor fought for his country. By 1871 the war had ended, and Napoleon III had fallen.
 
4. Laboulaye and Bartholdi hoped that the time might be right for democracy to take root in France. They thought that creating the statue now might encourage others to see the value of such a system. Bartholdi is quoted as saying: ""I will try to glorify the Republic and Liberty over there [in the United States] in the hope that someday I will find it again here.""
 
5. At first no one was sure what form the statue would take, but one thing was certain: If Bartholdi designed it, the monument was bound to be big. Nearly all of Bartholdi's pieces were created on a grand scale. Many people believed that the sculptor had been greatly influenced by what he saw when he visited Egypt. Impressed by the size of such structures as the pyramids and the Sphinx, Bartholdi longed for a sense of massiveness in his own work. His first public monument—commissioned when he was just eighteen —was a 12-foot (3.7 m) high statue of one of Napoleon's generals. Workmen had barely been able to remove the larger-than-life sculpture from Bartholdi's studio. Yet the work received a good deal of praise and helped establish its creator's reputation as an artist.
      
 *FINDING THE RIGHT PLACE*

6. Bartholdi was excited about doing a sculpture for the United States. To explore how the Americans would feel about it, Bartholdi headed for the U.S. in the summer of 1871. He hoped to drum up enthusiasm for the project as well as find an appealing location to display the work. Bartholdi spent most of his days on the voyage making sketches of different views of Lady Liberty. The sculptor had also brought along a small model of the proposed monument to give Americans a better idea of how the finished product would look.
 
7. Bartholdi did not have to look very far to find the perfect spot for Lady Liberty. He spied the ideal place for her as soon as his ship entered New York Harbor. It was Bedloe's Island, one of a group of small islands in the harbor. At one time, the Mohegan Indians had called the island Minnissais, which means ""Lesser Island,"" because it was so small. Despite its small size, the island seemed perfect for the project because New York Harbor was an active seaport where this tribute to liberty would get the attention it deserved. The French sculptor further described the location as a place ""where people [immigrants] get their first view of the New World."" He wanted them to see the statue before anything else.

     *SELLING THE IDEA*

8. Finding a suitable site for the monument was just one phase of Bartholdi's mission. Creating a sense of enthusiasm for the statue among Americans proved to be much more difficult. Laboulaye had supplied the young sculptor with letters of introduction to a number of important Americans. Bartholdi met with President Ulysses S. Grant and American literary figures, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, to talk about the project.
 
9. Although Bartholdi managed to pique the curiosity of some Americans, few appeared very enthusiastic. While the statue was to be a gift from the French, Americans would have to help finance it. Most of the people Bartholdi spoke to were not especially anxious to part with their money to make his dream come true. When Bartholdi returned to France, both he and Laboulaye agreed that they were not ready to begin construction.
 
10. The two Frenchmen made another attempt to get financial backing for the monument in 1874. They proposed dividing the cost of the monument between France and the United States. France would pay for the statue itself, while America was to pay for its pedestal and foundation. To speed things along, in 1875 Laboulaye formed the Franco-American Union, which included people from France as well as the United States. This organization worked to bring in donations on both sides of the Atlantic.
 
11. Though the original goal of completing the statue for the hundredth birthday (July 4, 1876) of the United States seemed unlikely, the group still did its best to meet that deadline. Appeals for donations for the statue appeared in the French press by the fall of 1875. The Franco-American Union proved quite creative in its fund-raising efforts. Banquets and balls were held in several French cities. The food and ballrooms for these occasions were donated, and all admission fees went to the statues fund. Bartholdi came up with just enough money to begin work on Lady Liberty.""",*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 29 through 35.*,"*Excerpt from The Statue of Liberty*

 2. Wendy bent down for a closer look. ""We shouldn't name them until we're sure we can keep them,"" she warned. ""But I like Woolly-Puffs. They look just like fleecy rainbows.""
 
 3. As tempting as it was to pet the feathery yellow-orange-red-purple-blue petals, neither of them did. Instead, Wendy pulled protective gloves from her belt pack.
 
 4. On the asteroid-based colony of New Harmony, even twelve-year-old pioneers knew the number one rule for living in outer space: don't touch or taste or sniff anything that hasn't been tested.
 
 5. ""Where do you think they came from?"" Wendy asked. With a gentle tug, she freed a Woolly-Puff from the thin layer of soil, sealed it in a clear bag.
 
 6. ""They were probably in the compost shipment that brought these naggers,"" Alex muttered. He slapped at one of the whining insects that swarmed around him looking for exposed skin to bite.
 
 7. New Harmony depended on shipments of rich compost from nearby planets to build up its soil. Usually the compost was treated before it arrived, but one shipment had been accidentally overlooked. The whining gnat-like insects the colonists called ""naggers"" had hatched from the compost. Without any natural enemies in this new world, the insects had multiplied, becoming a constant torment to the colonists.
 
 8. After turning in their discovery, Wendy settled on a stone bench in front of the New Harmony laboratory. Alex paced, then sat. ""Poor Woolly-Puff,"" Wendy said. ""What if it's just a weedy flower?""
 
 9. ""Then one living plant and a packet of seeds will be sent to the Botany Preserve on Mars,"" Alex answered, rubbing a hot-pink nagger welt just above his elbow.
 
 10. Wendy gingerly held the extra bouquet she had picked, in case the Woolly-PufFs proved keepers. ""And the rest of the plants—""
 
 11. ""The rest will be pulled up and destroyed to make room for useful' plants,"" Alex said.
 
 12. The colony of New Harmony did have flowers. It just didn't have a lot of room. Woolly-PufFs would have to be more than pretty if they wanted to grow here.
 
 13. The two friends scrambled to attention as the lab door opened.
 
 14. ""Your Woolly-PufF isn't toxic,"" Professor Raglin said. His smile faded as he went on. ""The sap is thick and sticky, but we already have a good glue. The stems are too woody and the leaves too bristly to eat. And the petals, well, they smell funny. Not flowery at all. More like moldy lemons. I'm sorry, but I'll have to make my report to the council this afternoon. The good news is that they seem to grow only in the soil where you found them, so it won't be hard to get rid of them.""
 
 15. ""At least they're not poison,"" Wendy said after Professor Raglin had left. She hugged her colorful, fuzzy bouquet. She had to admit they did smell funny. ""Mayor Murphy will probably send a reclaim crew out after the council meeting."" She sighed. ""I wish the council would let us adopt one, like a pet.""
 
 16. ""Fat chance,"" Alex said. He blew at a pair of naggers trying to land on his knee. ""Shoo! For harmless gnats, these bugs sure are pests.""
 
 17. ""Yeah."" Wendy reached up to scratch the end of her nose. Then she realized something. The end of her nose itched simply because that's what the ends of noses do sometimes. The naggers weren't biting her. They weren't even landing on her.
 
 18. ""We're going to the council meeting,"" she announced.
 
 19. That afternoon, when the council members emerged from the community center, Alex and Wendy were waiting.
 
 20. ""What is the meaning of this?"" Mayor Murphy demanded as Alex and Wendy presented each member of the council with a Woolly-Puff garland.
 
 21. Glancing at Alex for courage, Wendy said, ""Woolly-Puffs are bug chasers.""
 
 22. ""Sorry,"" Mayor Murphy said firmly. ""We have already made our decision.""
 
 23. ""Just watch,"" Wendy pleaded. ""Watch the naggers.""
 
 24. Then someone said, ""What naggers? I don't see any.""
 
 25. ""Where are the naggers?"" asked Professor Raglin. ""It's as if they're avoiding us.""
 
 26. Wendy smiled. ""They are. Naggers don't like Woolly-Puffs.""
 
 27. So the Woolly-Puffs stayed in the vases and flower boxes and gardens of New Harmony because, of course, they weren't just pretty. They smelled like moldy lemons. And luckily, naggers couldn't stand the smell of moldy lemons.""",*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 7*,"*Excerpt from The Woolly-Puff Rescue*

2018-released-items-ela-g5,2,"""1. One crisp fall morning, Mrs. Majeska woke up with a craving for sauerkraut. It was so strong, she could smell it, she could taste it, and she knew she must have it for supper. So she put on her walking shoes, picked up her tub with a lid and a handle, and went into town to buy some.
 
 2. She walked briskly, enjoying the wind messing up her hair and the parade of dried leaves dancing ahead of her. It was a glorious day, and the thought of sauerkraut for supper, with a bit of apple and onion and sausage, made her want to dance along with the leaves.
 
 3. But suddenly she stopped. In the road there was a glove, a small black glove, the fingers still plump, as if it had just left its owner's hand. It was out of place in the middle of the road.
 
 4. Poor thing, thought Mrs. Majeska. I cannot leave it there. She picked it up quickly— a logging truck was coming—and laid it on the grass. She felt sorry for its owner, who now had only one glove. What good was one glove?
 
 5. On the way home from the store, she walked on the other side of the road, the sauerkraut sloshing inside the tub. A cluster of children came toward her, laughing and shouting to one another as they took turns kicking something in the dust. Finally they tired of it and ran off past Mrs. Majeska.
 
 6. She looked down at the sorry thing they had been kicking. It was another black glove, of the same size and shape as the one she had rescued. She examined it—yes, it was the mate to the other!
 
 7. Mrs. Majeska hesitated, then continued walking. It was only a glove, after all, not a child or a kitten or a wallet. Suddenly she stopped, turned around, and walked back to the crumpled bit of cloth. She picked it up, shook it out, and brushed off the dirt. It looked almost as good as new.
 
 8. With the glove in one hand and the tub of sauerkraut in the other, she strode down the road to where the other glove still lay in the grass. She placed its mate beside it, satisfied that they were now together. For what good was one glove without the other?
 
 9. A boy whizzed by on a bike and looked at her. Two old ladies, arm in arm, marched toward her on their way to the post office. Mrs. Majeska bent down and pretended to tie her shoelaces, for she felt foolish to be caught in the act of reuniting a pair of gloves.
 
 10. That night, after a supper as delicious as she had imagined it, Mrs. Majeska sat in her rocker and thought about the gloves. She wished she had brought them home to use for herself. Their owner had probably already given them up for lost. The next morning, after she had her coffee and read the newspaper, she decided to go back and get the gloves. But they were gone.
 
 11. Mrs. Majeska was mystified. Who—beside herself—would want a pair of gloves lying by the side of the road? Perhaps the owner had retraced her steps and rejoiced in finding them? Or maybe a housewife on a cleaning binge had used them to polish the stove? Or maybe a puppy needed something to chew on? Or a squirrel, to line its nest for winter?

2018-released-items-ela-g5,3,"""1. John Roebling was a native of Germany. After studying engineering at his country's finest technical school, he came to the United States. It was 1831. Roebling was twenty- five years old. He wanted to put his skills and education to work. He and a group of fellow Germans purchased a large plot of land in Pennsylvania. The group built houses, stores, and churches on the land. They called their new farming town Saxonburg.
 
 2. Roebling found the farmer's life too quiet, though. He told his son, Washington, that he longed to ""employ science to useful purpose."" In the early 1840s, Roebling got his first chance to do just that. He knew a new type of rope called wire cable was being used in Europe. It was made from iron wires. These wires were twisted together to form a long strand. Roebling made the first iron wire cable in the United States.
 
 3. At first, people doubted that Roebling's cable could work better than rope. Once they tested it, though, they were amazed. The iron cable was thinner, stronger, and longer lasting than ordinary rope. Soon, delighted business owners were snatching up Roebling's iron cables. They used the cables to haul heavy loads over Pennsylvania's Allegheny Mountains.
 
 4. Roebling's cable helped him create the modern suspension bridge. A suspension bridge spans a wide body of water. Ancient bridges were held up by rope made from hemp. Today's bridges are held up by thick metal cables. The cables are attached to two strong towers, made of stone, steel, or iron. These towers hold the bridge in place. The roadway is suspended, or held up, by the cable.
 
 5. In 1861 the American Civil War began. John's son, Washington, served in the Union Army. He even fought in the battle at Gettysburg. As a colonel, he built temporary suspension bridges using his father's ideas. Washington soon became his father's chief engineer.
 
 6. Together, father and son built many suspension bridges. One of their most famous works was built in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati Bridge spanned the Ohio River. At the time, in 1872, it was the largest suspension bridge ever seen. It was a triumph of engineering skills. Yet both father and son knew that harder work lay ahead. John Roebling never rested. He was an ambitious, driven man. Once he got an idea for a new bridge, he never forgot it.
 
 7. John Roebling first presented his plan for the Brooklyn Bridge in 1867. His idea pleased many. Others thought Roebling's bridge seemed unnecessary. New Yorkers didn't go frequently to Brooklyn. To them, the project was a waste of money. On the other hand, Brooklyn's residents were in favor of a bridge. Brooklyn was growing fast as a city. Its residents needed an easier way to travel to New York for work, school, shopping, and entertainment.
 
 8. Public opinion was divided. However, the terrible winter of 1866-67 swayed many city leaders' minds. Icy conditions along the East River froze ferry service for days on end. This convinced Brooklyn's mayor that the city couldn't continue to grow without a bridge. Meanwhile, New Yorkers were warming to the idea, too. They knew that Brooklyn was booming. Still, it remained a cheaper and less crowded city than New York. It would be wonderful to have easy access to Brooklyn's charms. On April 16, 1867, New York's legislature created the New York Bridge Company. The company would be dedicated to Roebling's dream—constructing a bridge over the East River. John Roebling was asked to be the bridge's designer.
 
 9. Excitement about the bridge swelled. It was going to be unlike any structure seen before. Its length would measure 1,596 feet (486 m) from tower to tower. This would make it one-and-a-half times longer than the Cincinnati Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge's towers would feature 117-foot-high (35.7 m) Gothic arches. Horse and carriage riders would use outer lanes across the span. Trains would travel across the bridge's inner lanes. A special walkway, called a promenade, would be built above the roadways. Pedestrians, or people walking, would stroll across the promenade and be treated to magnificent views of the city.
 
 10. Everyone knew the completed bridge would be beautiful. However, many worried it would not be safe. Roebling invited a group of experts to study his plans. These experts were impressed with Roebling's vision. Finally, in 1869, all their questions were answered. The two cities gave their final approvals.""",*Directions Read this article.

 3. New York Museum of Archaeology was Addison's favorite place in the world. Great echoing halls filled with Egyptian mummies, Mongolian battle armor, a Viking warship, and the eastern wing of an Aztec temple. Deep down in the musty, snaking passageways of the basement archives was a secret underground world the public never saw. A labyrinth of vaults where millions of specimens were filed and stored. This was their uncle's workplace.
 
 4. Addison and Molly trotted through the dark corridors by feel, listening to the rising thunder rattling the cement walls above. They passed a long hallway crammed with crates of Ice Age bones for the Hall of Paleontology: saber-toothed tiger skulls with teeth curved like Arabian sickle swords, giant sloth femurs heavy as tree limbs, dire wolf claws sharp as switchblades. At last they spotted a light glowing from an office at the end of a dark passage.
 
 5. ""Uncle Nigel, we're here!"" Molly called. . . .
 
 6. ""Your aunt has a lot to worry about right now,"" explained Uncle Nigel. ""People don't visit museums as often as they used to. So your aunt and I have to work incessantly^2, like Slinkies on an escalator. If we don't find a great exhibit that will draw visitors back to the museum, our funding will be slashed and . . "" Uncle Nigel trailed off. Then, looking hard at Addison and Molly, he seemed to decide that honesty was the best policy. ""Well, we could lose our jobs""
 
 7. Addison and Molly weren't sure how to respond. Molly busied herself picking bits of turf from her cleats. Addison drew in his notebook, sketching the Cherokee headdress he saw draped over the filing cabinet.
 
 8. ""The point is,"" continued Uncle Nigel, ""your aunt is on a short fuse. And you'd be wise to be model children for her until we sail through this rough patch."" . . .
 
 9. ""Well, that's enough serious talk,"" said Uncle Nigel. ""I just returned from a dig in the jungles of Bolivia and found the most improbable relic. An artifact that's not even supposed to exist! I don't suppose you'd like to see it?""
 
 10. ""I don't see why not,"" said Addison, who could think of nothing better than a strange relic from a distant country.
 
 11. As Uncle Nigel talked, Addison's eyes darted to the shadowy corners of the office, containing relics from every era of history. Ancient maps, papyrus scrolls, and decaying mummies. Blood-encrusted samurai swords from feudal Japan. Maasai spears decorated in ostrich feathers. The fossil skeleton of an extinct dodo bird. Even the ten foot tusk of a narwhal, spiraled like a unicorn's horn. . . .
 
 12. Uncle Nigel nodded and wound up his tale. ""The Incas never delivered their treasure. Instead, they locked it away in a secret chamber and hid three keys across the Incan Empire. Each key contains a clue leading to the next. Locals believe Atahualpa's treasure is cursed . . . Fortune hunters have searched for it over the centuries, and none have returned alive. Legends say the treasure vault will open only for someone who has learned from King Atahualpa's mistakes"" . . .
 
 13. ""So what did you find on your dig in Bolivia?"" Addison asked quietly.
 
 14. ""Oh, only this,"" replied Uncle Nigel, unlocking the safe behind his desk and removing a fragile wooden box. He pried open the mildewed lid and tilted it to the light.
 
 15. Addison's jaw dropped in amazement. Molly's followed suit. Inside the box lay an intricately carved stone, roughly the size of a large chess piece.
 
 16. ""One of the three keys!"" cried Addison.
 
 17. More thunder broke outside the museum. It shook the walls, as if giants upstairs were rearranging their furniture, and repeatedly changing their minds on where to set the couch. The wind howled so fiercely it could be heard even in the basement.
 
 18. Molly shivered. ""Is it real?""
 
 19. Uncle Nigel allowed himself a smile. ""I'm pretty sure it is Atahualpa's first key,"" he replied, his precise Oxford accent elegantly slicing the words into perfect squares. ""Though the key is made of stone, so we can't carbon-date it.""",*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 7.*,"*Excerpt from Addison Cooke and the Treasure of the Incas*

2019-released-items-ela-g6,2,"""1. Were we related? I had to find out.
 
 2. I grew up in a house without books. Our family owned only an encyclopaedia and a well-used dictionary. The only other books we had were those we borrowed from the library.
 
 3. The day I was able to write the seventeen letters of my name and receive my library card was one I can remember as if it were yesterday, right down to the big desk that smelled of paper and paste and ink. I was so afraid that I'd made a mistake and would be banished from this wondrous place where the books lived. But I succeeded. The card was mine. My life as a reader had begun!
 
 4. When I was ten, I found a book at the library about celebrated women. The book said that the American woman with the most statues in her honor was a Shoshone Indian named Sacagawea. She had been an interpreter on Lewis and Clark's great voyage from 1804 to 1806, joining them in the spring of 1805.
 
 5. President Jefferson had hired Lewis and Clark and their band of adventurers to map and explore the United States, including the vast new territory just acquired from France in the Louisiana Purchase. Sacagawea was the only woman to go with them. She made the perilous journey across half our continent with her baby on her back. The presence of a mother and child was a sign that the expedition was a peaceful one and helped keep it safe from Indian attack.
 
 6. Sacagawea provided a woman's laughter, strength, and endurance on the journey. During a boat mishap, she remained calm and saved instruments and documents from floating down the Missouri River. Lewis and Clark needed Shoshone horses and guidance over the Rocky Mountains, so Sacagawea's help translating was crucial to the expedition's success.
 
 7. When I discovered that Sacagawea and I had the same last name—Charbonneau—I jumped up from my place at my father's feet and announced my discovery to him.
 
 8. My father put down his newspaper. Yes, he knew about the woman and her brave trek across the territory that was to become part of the United States. Yes, this woman had been married to a French Canadian named Charbonneau. Daddy's father was also a French Canadian. I asked if we could possibly be related.
 
 9. My father said he didn't know, but he'd wondered himself if we had a common ancestor.
 
 10. From that day on, it became our project. We used the resources of the Library of Congress, which began its collection with President Jefferson's books. We explored tiny libraries on American Indian reservations. We visited libraries in Canada, France, and Ireland, and we also entered the ever-expanding web of cyberspace. In search of our family, we made friends with the world.
 
 11. After hours spent in the National Archives in Washington, D.C., poring over passenger lists of great ocean liners, I recognized the name of a girl from Ireland. I knew she had seen the Statue of Liberty for the first time on her nineteenth birthday in 1894. She had traveled across the Atlantic with one suitcase and the dream of a better life. Like Sacagawea, she was to marry a man named Charbonneau. ""Dad!"" I yelled. ""Look! It's grandma!""
 
 12. My father and I located family members galore on our search. One ran an ice-cream stand in the beautiful Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, Canada. Three brothers changed their name to Cole before traveling south to fight in the American Civil War. Two centuries before them, another set of Charbonneau brothers had been traders with the Indians of the American West. One of these brothers fathered our line. The other's descendants led to the fur trader Toussaint, husband of Sacagawea, always facing west in her statues.
 
 13. So now we know how we're related. We're cousins of the Shoshone woman with the baby on her back who explored America by canoe, horseback, and on foot to map it for the first time. Her baby, Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau, also called Pomp, was educated by Captain William Clark and became a guide, too. He traveled through Europe as the guest of a prince and could understand five languages. Once he helped the United States govern an Indian mission in California, but lost his position for being ""too
 fair"" to the Indians. I think I would have liked that cousin.
 
 14. Now I'm a storyteller. I travel through the past to find stories for my own books. In search of stories I spend lots of time in libraries, for that's still where the books live. In books and in life, the words of a Lakota Indian saying ring true for me: Mitakuye oysain, ""We are all related.""",*Directions Read this article.

2019-released-items-ela-g6,3,"""1. In Ancient Egypt, only the very smartest children went to school, where they learned to read and write. Most Egyptians did not ever learn to read and write.

2. The children who went to school learned to be scribes. Scribes were very important people in Ancient Egypt because they were almost the only ones who could read and write. Although records tell us that there were a few female scribes, most were men. Boys entered scribal school when they were quite young and studied hard for about 10 to 12 years.

3. It took years to learn how to write the hundreds of signs called _hieroglyphs._ Ancient Egyptians used hieroglyphs to write their language. Just think, you only have to learn 26 letters!
 
4. Scribes also had to know how to write _hieratic._ This was a kind of shorthand script used for everyday writing.
 
5. Students memorized the hieroglyphic signs and practiced writing them on pieces of stone, pottery, or wood. They practiced by copying all kinds of things that had already been written: letters, literature, religious records, and business and government documents. In this way, students learned about more than just their language.
 
6. Scribal students used writing tools somewhat like the parts of a water color set you might have. Ink was shaped into round disks, just like our paint sets. But instead of many colors, scribes used only red and black. The cakes of ink were made out of the mineral red ochre and out of black carbon from burnt sticks or pans. Scribes carried small pots of water to mix with the inks. Their brushes, made of reed plants, were held in a small case. The hieroglyph that spells ""scribe"" contains all of these different parts.
 
7. Students often practiced writing on flat pieces of the limestone rock that could be found everywhere in Egypt. Many school texts, or homework, have been found on these flakes of stone. Sometimes a student or a scribe needed to write something very important. Then he wrote on papyrus paper, made from the papyrus plant that grew in the marshes along the Nile.
 
8. When a student finished scribe school, he could get a good job in Ancient Egypt. He might become a doctor or a priest, the secretary to a noble family, the boss of a group of workers, or have some other job that required the ability to read and write.
 
9. The Egyptians wrote as many different kinds of things as we do. They wrote letters home and sent bills for work they'd done. They wrote poetry and stories and put down words of wisdom and advice for their children. They wrote many prayers to their gods.
 
10. Parents were happy to pay the high price to send a child to scribal school. Read these words, from a father to his son. They were written about 4,000 years ago, to convince the son of the advantages of going to school.""",*Directions Read this article.

2019-released-items-ela-g8,1,"""1. By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.

2. But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn't seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that's what it became.

3. Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.

4. The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.

5. Most people don't start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.

6. But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.

7. So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court.

8. In 1963, Con Edison, New York City's power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.

9. But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn't speak for it, who would?

10. Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.

11. After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.

12. More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.

13. The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.

14. Many new laws and new citizens' groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.

15. The Mahicans called it ""The River that Flows Both Ways."" Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.

16. Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.

17. It's now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.""","*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 15 through 21.*

I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother's quiet office downstairs.
 
2. ""Order!""

3. The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.
 
4. It's hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn't been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.
 
5. La Salle Rouge doesn't serve much in the way of ""kid"" food, since the menu doesn't cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I've loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I'm the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.
 
6. Pia's been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other's tastes— Mom's traditional Southern flavors and Pia's French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called ""stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.""

7. Whatever that means.

8. Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it's been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it's smarter to have a ""backup plan,"" and she's made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you're anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I'm going to do.

9. First, I'm going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child's kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don't let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don't know where—I'm going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint.1 She's the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn't start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.
 
10. The second thing I'm going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I've seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.

11. The third thing I'm going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I'm going to have to pay my dues, but I'm so ready for my real life to start. It's not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren't? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.""",*Directions Read this Story.

2019-released-items-ela-g8,3,"""1. Women's rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one.But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the American Wheelman celebrating this ""wonderful new style of locomotion."" In the article, titled ""The Era of the Bicycle,"" she pointed out that cycling was increasing people's mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle's effects on women. ""The bicycle,"" she wrote, ""will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.""

2. For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a cosmic shift in women's private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. ""At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,"" remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a bicycle at age 53. ""I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life's sweetest joys.""

3. While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.

4. It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. ""I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,"" she wrote. ""He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.""

5. For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the Minneapolis Tribune. ""I can't see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,"" she declared. ""I would as lief1 talk to one inanimate object as another; and I'd a great deal rather talk to one that can't answer than one that won't."" Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. ""You can make your wheel tidy over night,"" she said, ""and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.""

6. Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. ""The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women's rights' would ever have produced,"" wrote the L.A. W Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey's Magazine assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. ""If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,"" the editors wrote.

7. ""She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.' She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,' who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power."" Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.

8. Not all publications treated the emergence of the ""new woman"" with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women.""",*Directions Read this article.

Families have to consider the type of pet to adopt, the best size of pet for their space, and the people living in their home. It is worth taking the time to pick the right pet. Having a pet is good for our health.

*Exercise Benefits*

2. Some pets can make people more active. A group of researchers did a study that recorded people's exercise habits for 10 months. The study included people who had dogs at home and people who did not. The researchers found that the dog owners exercised more often. They also exercised for longer periods of time.

3. Dogs depend on their owners to take them on a stroll around the neighborhood or toss a ball to them. These activities provide exercise for pet owners. Exercise helps people and their pets stay healthy.

4. Some people choose not to have a pet because they don't like to exercise. However, exercise is a necessity for everyone. It is best to make exercise fun. Many people enjoy walking or running with their pet rather than by themselves or with others.

*Calming Benefits*

5. A pet can reduce a person's health problems. Many health problems come from experiencing frequent and intense stress. Pets have been shown to help reduce stress. Having a pet in the home means less anxiety for the people living there.

6. Some people say pets can cause stress. This is true when pets misbehave. However, there are many resources out there to help people train their pet. A trained pet can have a calming effect on a family.

7. Pets have also provided companionship to hospital patients. Researchers monitored patients at a hospital that allowed pets in patients' rooms. They compared patients who had a pet's companionship with those who did not. The researchers studied how long it took for each patient's <u>condition<u>to improve. The study found that people had a faster recovery when a pet was with them. Pets make people calm. Calm patients heal more quickly.

*Health Benefits*

8. Petting a dog or a cat can help prevent sudden illnesses. Some of these illnesses include strokes and heart attacks. A study in Minnesota found that petting a cat can help protect people from these types of emergencies by lowering our stress levels and blood pressure.

9. Many people believe that pets cause allergies in children. One surprising health benefit researchers have discovered goes against this belief. It turns out that pets can help prevent allergies in children.

10. In 2011 a study was done in Detroit on babies who had been around pets from birth to age one. The children studied had a smaller chance of becoming allergic to pets when the children got older.
Exposing young children to pets can protect the children by decreasing their chances of developing pet allergies.

*Emotional Benefits*

11. Pets can make people feel happy and also keep away feelings of loneliness. Research has shown that pets provide social support. People experience feelings of loneliness less often when they have a pet at home. Pets can give meaning and a sense of purpose to people's lives.

12. The many benefits of pet ownership are available to all who open their home to a furry friend.

2022-staar-may-grade-5-reading-releasedtest,4,"""1. Devon Wallick had been working on his speech for a long time. He practiced it many times in front of friends, teachers and the mirror.

2. Even so, he didn't feel quite ready. He was nervous to speak in front of a large group of people. He needed help. That's why he decided to visit Dexter.

"" *Not Your Average Public Speaking Coach* ""

3. Dexter is an English springer spaniel with giant white paws and floppy ears. Obviously, he's not your average public speaking coach. He is one of eight ""audience dogs."" They work at the Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington, D.C. These pooches volunteer to help students practice speaking in public.

4. Wallick pet Dexter as he practiced. The dog, listening, licked Wallick's right hand.

5. Rob Cheek is Dexter's owner. He said the pup's love of people and focused look are his strong suits. The pair was recruited after they were spotted walking on the school grounds.

6. Dexter seems to like his volunteer job. His excitement might have something to do with the bag of treats. Students practicing their speeches have them waiting for him.

7. Wallick briefly laughed during the first of two readings with Dexter. He later explained that it was because the dog did not look
interested in what he was doing. But, he thought it was helpful to be able to make light of what ""has been a very serious process.""

*Make A Mistake? Dogs Do Not Care*

8. Unlike humans, who hear a speech and can't help but judge its quality, dogs aren't <u>judgmental<u>. It doesn't matter if students mess up. The dogs won't know if they do. They are there to support the students and help them feel less nervous.

9. The program began thanks to Caron Martinez. She is the director of the Kogod Center for Business Communications. She also happens to be the owner of one of the audience dogs, 11-year-old Reggie.

10. Martinez thinks that dogs can have a calming effect on people. After doing a session with the audience dogs, students reported feeling less nervous, she said. She added that the best way to deliver a great speech is to practice.

11. ""How do you get students to practice? Any way you can,"" she said. Getting to practice with dogs might make some students practice more.

12. Any student at the school that has a presentation to deliver can book 30 minutes with one of the audience dogs. Wallick said he signed up because he needed more practice.

13. He said he weighed the pros and cons of signing up to work with Dexter. For him, the benefits were worth the time it took up.

*Sasha's Speech*

14. Later that day, at 3 p.m., student Sasha Gilthorpe is getting ready to give a speech at school. She will be speaking in front of about 4,000 people on graduation day. But, today she is only giving a speech to one audience member, and it is a dog named Noche.

15. ""When I felt myself shake a little bit at the end, I looked at Noche and I was like, ‘I'm all good,'"" Gilthorpe said. ""I'm going to imagine an audience full of Noches.""

2022-staar-may-grade-5-reading-releasedtest,5,"""1. Isabella and Soledad Meade really know what it means to rock. In fact, they do it every day after they finish their homework! Even though they're only in elementary school the sisters from Milford, Connecticut, are already the owners of Rock On, a painted rock business that they accidentally started back in May 2010. Accidentally? Well. Kind of. The whole thing began as a gift for their mom.

2. ""On Mother's Day I decided to make my mom a garden because she likes plants, and I thought it needed color,"" says Isabella, 10. ""So I painted some rocks."" Soledad, 8, noticed that her sister could use some creative help, so she began arranging the rocks around the garden to make it look even more beautiful.

3. When they showed the garden to their mom, she was overwhelmed. ""It was a surprise, and we yelled ‘Happy Mother's Day!'"" Soledad says. ""My mom kept saying, ‘Thank you so much,' and gave us lots of hugs.""

4. Their dad was also impressed with the girls' work. ""Our dad said we should start our own business,"" explains Soledad.

5. Mr. Meade put the pictures of the rocks on his social media page. People began to take notice, posting messages asking how much they cost. Then they began ordering rocks. The family couldn't believe it!

6. But earning money for themselves wasn't enough. The girls wanted to use the rocks to benefit others. ""I'm a helper person,"" says Isabella. ""I have all these ideas in my mind that are too big for me, but I am always thinking about how I can help people.""

7. Every year the family donates to a homeless shelter, but the girls wanted to do even more. So they decided to hold a rock-painting contest as a fundraiser for Get In Touch, a non-profit breast cancer awareness organization started by a family friend. People paid $5 to enter their painted rocks in the contest. Others made generous donations. When it was over, the sisters had raised $250! The giving experience felt so good, they decided they would donate a portion of all of Rock On's profits to Get In Touch.


8. With the help of their family, the two set up a workstation over their garage. Rocks and paint take up two huge tables, one for painting and the other for drying. ""We do it one at a time,"" says Soledad. ""I do the background and when it dries, Bella does the design.""

9. Lately they've been thinking about painting other things, too. ""My dad found these chairs our neighbor was throwing out,"" says Isabella. Mr. Meade brought them home for the girls to paint. They weren't up on social media more than a few days when they sold.

10. ""I'm getting better as an artist, and I just want to grow with our business,"" says Soledad, who plans to be a full-time artist when she gets older. ""Hopefully we can continue to make money for college.""

11. ""And help the community,"" Isabella adds.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in the answer on your answer document*.,"*Rock and Soul*

His father, Saihan, was one of the bravest warriors and wisest leaders in the Mongolian empire. In fact, he was a close friend and advisor to the great Khan.

2. The knowledge of his father's power, however, proved to be dangerous for young Baatar. Whenever he played with his friends, he would treat them like they were his servants. He yelled at them and ordered them to do silly things just to prove how important he was. Actually, none of his friends were really friends at all. Nobody liked or respected him. They only played with him because they had to.

3. His father was concerned about his son's behavior. He knew he had to teach him what it truly meant to be a leader.

4. ""Baatar, my son,"" he said one day. ""I understand that you eagerly await the day when you will become a great leader. This day will come. But first, I must demand that you travel west, to a very distant land and find a treasure.""

5. ""Is it not something I can get here in Mongolia? Perhaps we can send one of the servants into the mountains to find it.""

6. ""No, you can only find it in a distant land.""

7. ""What is this thing, Father?""

8. ""It's called a sponge.""

9. ""But I don't even know what a sponge is. How will I know when I have found it?""

10. ""You will know.""

11. _What kind of a thing is this sponge?_ he wondered. He thought that it must be something of immense value for his father to have sent his own son to look for it.

12. Baatar traveled on foot for weeks, then months. Of those he met, nobody knew what a sponge was, and nobody knew who his father was, either. Few people gave him food or shelter, so he had to sleep under trees and eat whatever he could find in the forest. After months of living like this, he was so tired and desperate that he gave up on the thought of ever finding his treasure and returning home. All he wanted was a warm place to sleep and some food in his belly.

13. Eventually, he settled in a great city by the sea, sleeping on the street, learning the strange language of the people, and begging for food.

14. One day, Baatar saw a man dressed in rich, colorful clothing. He could tell the man was a prince or maybe even the Khan of this city. The man's eyes fell on Baatar, and he approached the boy. He held out his hand and motioned for Baatar to take it and go with him. Baatar had nothing to lose, so he went along.

15. They came to a great palace, and the kind man (whom Baatar learned was a king, and a kind ruler) left him in a building with many people who were hard at work. They cleaned, cooked and mended. There he lived for a long time, working for his food and bed.

16. One day, as Baatar scrubbed away next to another servant, he stopped to rest and looked down at his bucket. From out of the water, he lifted the dripping thing that he used every day to clean the floor.

17. ""Antonio, what is this thing we use to scrub the floors?"" Baatar asked him.

18. ""It's a sponge, silly. Every servant should know that.""

19. Baatar's eyes opened wide in amazement. This was the treasure his father had asked for.

20. ""Antonio,"" he cried. ""I've found it. I'm going home!""
21. Baatar jumped up and rushed to the door of the king's chambers. He told him the whole story—about his country and his father, about his dreadful journey, and about the treasure he'd been sent to find. He asked the king for permission to leave. The king not only granted his permission, but also gave Baatar several horses and food for his journey.

22. After many months of travel, Baatar finally went into his father's encampment and knelt at his father's feet. His father, older and graying, smiled at Baatar.

23. ""My son, it has been a long time. I am happy to see such a fine young man before me. Have you found the treasure I asked of you?""

24. ""Yes, Father,"" Baatar replied, and handed him the sponge.

25. ""Now, my dutiful young warrior, explain to me why I sent you so far to find such a trifle.""

26. ""You sent me to find this thing so that I would learn what it meant to be a servant. Only through living as a servant would I know how to lead wisely, to lead with compassion and justice—like you, father.""

27. At that, the father embraced his son and cried.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in the answer on your answer document*.,"*A Leader*

2021-released-items-ela-g3,1,"""1. Craig watched his older sister, Riley, and her friend Liz race up and down the lake on their skates, dodging the other hockey players. Their skate blades looked like silver smoke.

2. When the game was over, the girls skated up to the bench where Craig was sitting. Craig asked Riley what skating felt like.

3. ""When I go really fast, I feel like I'm flying,"" she said.

4. That's silly, thought Craig. Flying is something birds do in the air, not something people do on ice skates. Then he watched Riley go back out on the ice. She skated around and around the edge of the lake with her arms pumping and her scarf trailing behind her. Soon she was going so fast that her arms looked like wings and her scarf looked like a feathery tail. Maybe skating really was like flying.

5. When Riley sat down to take her skates off, Craig said, ""I wish I could fly.""

6. Riley retied her skate laces and crouched next to Craig. ""Get on my back,"" she said, and Craig did. Riley started skating, but Craig didn't feel like he was flying. It just felt like a wobbly piggy-back ride.

7. ""You're too heavy,"" Riley said. ""I can't go fast when I'm carrying you."" She skated slowly back to the bench. Craig got off her back.

8. ""Even if you could go fast, I wouldn't be flying,"" he said sadly. ""I need skates to fly.""

9. Riley didn't say anything on the walk home, but a few days later she asked Craig if he wanted to go skating.

10. ""To watch?"" he asked.

11. ""No, to skate,"" she said cheerfully. ""Mom and I found a pair of my old skates. They might fit you.""

12. The skates were a little big, but when Riley stuffed newspaper in the toes, they fit. Craig couldn't stop smiling. He didn't want to take them off, but he had to so he could walk to the lake.

13. Riley and Liz went with him. They carried their hockey sticks, two orange cones, and a wooden chair. When they got to the lake, Craig put his skates back on and Riley helped him onto the ice. Then she put his hands on the back of the chair.

14. ""Hang on to this and you won't fall,"" she said. ""Just push it along in front of you, OK?""

15. Craig grinned. ""OK."" His feet felt wobbly, but he held on to the chair and he didn't fall. Riley and Liz cheered him on as he started to move forward. Then they set up the cones and practiced passing the puck to each other and shooting goals.

16. Craig watched them. They made skating look easy. He tried to skate like them, but when he let go of the chair he fell. So he grabbed on to it again and inched along. His skate blades went _scritch scritch scritch_ instead of the _swish swish_ sound that his sister's blades made. This wasn't like flying at all. It was like being a snail.

17. ""Ready to go home?"" Riley finally asked.

18. Craig nodded, frowning. Riley had never said how hard skating was.

19. ""What's wrong?"" she asked.

20. ""I wanted to skate like you,"" Craig said. ""I wanted to fly.""

21. ""Someday you will,"" Riley said. ""It takes practice."" She patted his shoulder. Then she whispered something to Liz, who grinned and winked at Craig. Each girl took one of Craig's hands.

22. ""Someday you'll fly on your own,"" Riley said. ""But today Liz and I will help you.""

23. Riley and Liz started skating, pulling Craig with them. The edges of his skate blades just touched the ice. The girls went faster and faster, and so did he. When he looked down, his skate blades were a silver blur. His hat nearly blew off.

24. ""I'm flying!"" he yelled, and the words blew away in the wind like a bird's happy song.""

2021-released-items-ela-g3,2,"""1. Flash! Lightning streaks from a dark cloud.

2. Crash! Thunder shakes our roofs and windows. A lightning storm dazzles the sky like flickering fireworks.

*Lightning Begins*

3. High above the ground, water droplets a n d ice crystals swirl and swarm inside the moving clouds. The tiny particles b u m p into one another. When the particles rush together, they become charged. Electricity is created.

*Lightning is Electricity*

4. A single stroke of lightning carries millions of volts of electricity. Each stroke heats the air in its path to as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,760 degrees Celsius). That is five times as hot as the surface of the sun.

*Thunder and Lightning*

5. The heat from lightning makes the air expand quickly. Expanding air makes a booming, bursting sound like a firecracker. This is the sound of thunder. Thunder and lightning happen at the same time. Light travels faster than sound. This is why we often see the flash before we hear the boom.

*How Far Lightning Travels*

6. Lightning can flash faster than you can blink. Durin g a single flash, lightning can streak down to the ground and back up to the clouds. A lightning stroke that flashes down to earth can stretch up to nine miles (14 kilometers). That's taller than the world's highest mountain. Lightning flashes from cloud to cloud can travel even longer distances.

7. Ribbon lightning darts from the sky. It looks like jagged streaks side by side. Forked lightning looks like an upside-down tree. The branches of electricity reach through the clouds. Sheet lightning streaks inside a cloud. The cloud lights up like a bright, white sheet. Heat lightning happens during the hot summer. It looks like faraway flashes in the sky. Heat lightning is too far away for its thunder to be heard.

*Lightning Around the World*

8. Every day, lightning flashes from thousands of thunderstorms around the world. Every second, more than 100 lightning bolts hit the ground. Lightning can strike a tree or dry grass. When this happens, a wildfire can start. Lightning bolts can h it tall buildings. Th e y also can hit electrical towers, houses, and cars.

9. Flash! Lightning is streaking through the clouds. Every flash is another display of nature 's fireworks.

*Fast Facts*

10. It does not have to be raining outside for lightning to strike. Lightning can strike both before and after the rain falls, or even when there is no rain at all. Lightning helps nature by putting nitrogen into the ground and air. Nitrogen is a nutrient. That means it feeds plants and helps them grow.

*Safety Tips*

11. Windows, water faucets, pipes, telephones, and electrical outlets can be dangerous when there is lightning in the sky. You should not run water or talk on the phone if you see lightning. You could get an electrical shock.

12. Benjam in Franklin once flew a kite in a lightning storm. That is how he learned about electricity. But today, we know lightning is very dangerous. If you see lightning, you should go indoors right away.""

2021-released-items-ela-g3,3,"""1. Dad handed me the bucket and the net with a long, wooden handle. He gave Paulie two dead fish wrapped in newspaper. They were tied up with string like a present. I held my nose, but Paulie held those fish like they were his best baseball cards.

2. The briny air from Chesapeake Bay filled our noses. This was the best place in the world to catch blue crabs. They like grassy, shadowy water, so Paulie and I headed for our old wooden dock. It was hot for June, and I sat down and swung my legs over the edge, into the cool water. Paulie struggled to tie the string to one of the slippery fish. Then he slid the extra fish into the bucket and set it in the dark water under the dock for later. 

3. ""Here."" Paulie handed me the baited string. ""Dangle this down in the water to call the crabs.""

4. Crabs love stinky old fish, so our first crab didn't take long to come. Its big claw clamped the bait, and I raised the string real slow so Paulie could net it. But my legs swishing in the water startled that crab, and it let go and floated back to the bottom like a leaf off a tree. Paulie brought up the net and stood there with the handle on the dock. . . .

5. I went back to dangling the fish.

6. ""Well, get ready,"" he urged. ""Here comes another one.""

7. The sun was hot on our backs. My clothes were already sticking to me, and sweat trickled down our faces. A fly buzzed around my head. I remembered what Paulie had said and sat perfectly still as the new crab clamped onto the fish. But as Paulie scootched forward on his belly to lower the net, he knocked a pebble off the dock and scared that crab away, too. . . .

8. ""Crabs are scaredy-cats,"" I said, pulling up the line to check the bait. ""This smells disgusting. How can they eat this?""

9. ""I don't know. How can Mom and Dad eat broccoli casserole? I really hate that stuff,"" Paulie moaned.

10. ""Me, too,"" I said. ""Blech!""

11. We thought about the big pot waiting and Dad dropping the crabs into the spicy, boiling water. They would turn a beautiful bright red after a few moments, and we'd have a crab feast, cracking the shells and pulling out the sweet white meat. We _had_ to keep trying. I smacked a mosquito off Paulie's arm and dangled the bait some more. We squinted past the sun's reflection on the water.

12.""Sit still now. Here comes another one,"" said Paulie.

13. He inched the net into the water.

14. ""Got him!""

15. Paulie hauled up the net with the crab inside, but that crab was all claws and those mad pincers were waving all over the place! 

16. ""Look out!"" I screamed, but the crab's big claw already had hold of Paulie's finger.

17. ""Ow! OW! Get him off! Get him off!""

18. Paulie hopped around, shaking his hand up and down, swinging that crab all over the place.

19. I yelled, ""Let go!"" but the crab didn't seem to understand English. Finally, Paulie swung his arm in a giant arc, and the crab landed back in the water. Paulie's finger was all red and puffy. I could tell he was trying not to cry.

20. ""What should we do now?"" I asked.

21. We both thought about broccoli casserole.

22. ""Keep trying,"" said Paulie, dunking his sore finger into the cold water.

23. But the harder we tried, the darker it got. When the sun began to set, we couldn't see into the water anymore. We heard Mom yell from the house, ""Bring all you've got and come on in now.""

24. Paulie let go of the string and wiped his hands clean on his shorts as the stinky bait sank to the bottom.

25. ""Guess what's for supper,"" I sighed.

26. ""Broccoli, here we come,"" Paulie groaned.

27. ""Remember to get the bucket with the spare bait,"" I reminded him, slumping along with the net dragging behind me.

28. Suddenly, Paulie grabbed my arm. ""Listen,"" he whispered.

29. Noises came from the bucket Paulie was carrying. We leaned in close, but it was too dark to see.

30. ""What's all that scratching?"" I asked. We ran through the sand to the light of the screened-in porch.

31. ""Well, would you look at that?"" exclaimed Paulie with a high-five. There, in the bucket, was a mountain of beautiful blue crabs fighting over our extra fish.

32. ""Let's go!"" I yelled.

33. We raced to give Dad the crabs.

34. ""Whoa!"" he said. ""You caught a lot!""

35. ""Great!"" Mom said. ""Well, I don't think that the leftover casserole will keep for another day . . ."" She started scraping the broccoli into the garbage disposal.

36. I looked at Paulie. ""Yes!"" we mouthed silently to each other with huge grins.""",*Directions Read this story.

2021-released-items-ela-g4,1,"""1. The clock must be frozen. Or maybe the space station fell into a time warp and I'm trapped in my math lesson forever. The truth is that time doesn't fly when you're waiting for something, and I've waited for a friend for a long time.

2. _Crackle_. ""The radius ..."" _Crackle_. Static swirls across the holo-video screen, burying my teacher's image in a blizzard of white noise that my dad and I nicknamed snow.

3. A voice comes over the loudspeakers. ""Magnetic storm. Communications down. Remain in shielded areas. Technicians report to ...""

4. The announcement drones on, but I don't listen. A snow day. Hurray for space weather!

5. Eleven years ago, my birth on Space Station Alpha made history. I was the first human born off-planet. My parents knew just what to name me Jemison Mae, after Mom's hero, Mae Jemison, the first black female astronaut. Except I feel more like a science experiment than a hero.

6. It didn't take doctors long to discover I was different. Sure, on the outside I look normal. Just your average 11-year-old girl. But inside I flunk every test. My bones are too thin and my muscles are too weak. It seems humans don't grow well in the low-gravity, antiseptic halls of space stations. Not well enough to survive on Earth, anyway. I am sentenced to life in space.

7. After they figured this out, no other kids were allowed on board the space station. But new studies show that older children won't be harmed by a short stay. Today, a shuttle will arrive carrying a new technician and her family, including a girl my age. My first friend, Vianna. Freed from class by the snow day, I race down the corridor to message her.

8. Spending 11 years on the station has its advantages. I know more about it than anyone else does, even the commander. Other than my parents and me, most people spend one or two years here, then return to Earth. I've explored every inch of the place and uncovered some useful items.

9. When I was five, one of the techs showed me the Space Alpha Text booth, or S.A.T. ""Practice your letters on this, Jem,"" he said. ""No one uses it now that we have the holo-video."" The small room held a keyboard and the outdated communications system. I sat for hours fascinated by the way the screen lit up as I tapped the keys. The booth became my secret hideout, a place to disappear.

10. Now I shut the door and slide behind the keyboard. Vianna and I have been exchanging messages for months. Were not allowed to tie up the holo-video system with chatter, but I got the S.A.T. going after looking through old manuals. I tap in my code and read her message: _Jem, something's wrong a storm_.

11. I type back: _Don't worry. It's a magnetic storm, a snow day. We get them a lot_.

12. Vianna's words flash back: _You sure? My parents and the pilot look worried_.

13. Before I can answer, a message flashes in caps: _WE CAN'T DOCK_!

14. I bolt out the door, heading for the command room. The tension stops me in the doorway like a force field.

15. ""Captain, the holo-video won't work during the storm,"" my father is saying. ""They'll have to try docking by sight.""

16. ""With shields up, they don't have visual. They're flying blind,"" the captain says. I clear my throat. ""Could they lower the shields?""

17. The captain shakes his head. ""Dropping the shields would kill them. Even with shields they're in danger in a full-blown storm like this.""

18. ""_No_!"" I cry.

19. My father puts his hands on my shoulders. ""Jem, we're doing everything we can.

20. Tears slide down my cheeks. ""Snow days are supposed to be fun.""

21. He sighs. ""Snow days can be fun, when you're safe at home. But like real snow on Earth, it can be dangerous if you're stranded or traveling. The shuttle's shields aren't as strong as the station's. If the holo-video worked, we could talk them in.""

22. ""Can you text them in?"" I ask. ""With the S.A.T.?""

23. The captain looks over. ""What are you talking about?""

24. ""An old system, before holo-video,"" my father explains. ""It hasn't been used in years.""

25. ""Does it still work?"" says the captain.

26. ""It does,"" I blurt out. ""I've been texting Vianna for months.""

27. ""You're in touch with the shuttle?"" My father rushes me to the S.A.T. booth.

28. Techs swarm my hideout. I give one tech my code and watch her fingers fly over the keyboard. Messages flash back and forth as techs feed docking coordinates to the shuttle.

29. Minutes pass.

30. Then the message I've waited for fills the screen:

""1. The snow leopard is rarely seen by humans. This mysterious cat lives in 12 Asian countries among the world's tallest mountains.

2. The snow leopard is smaller than the tiger, the lion, and the leopard of Africa and Asia. It weighs as much as a cheetah, but is shorter and stockier. The cat's compact shape and thick fur help keep it warm in glacier-chilled air. Dark markings dapple its light-gray coat, camouflaging it in rocky terrain. Big paws make padding over snow easier. An extra-long tail provides balance on steep, rugged ground.

3. You might think the snow leopard would be safe living in such harsh, remote places. But it faces multiple threats from humans. The cat has lost important stretches of habitat. (A habitat is the place that fills an animal's needs—mainly food, shelter, and mates.) Mining, wars, and overgrazing by farm animals have all led to this loss of habitat.

*Protecting the Herd*

4. The loss of habitat has caused a food shortage. Snow leopards eat wild goats and sheep. When farm animals eat too much vegetation, wild plant eaters can't find enough food to stay healthy. Females don't have enough babies. Over time, the numbers of wild goats and sheep go down, and snow leopards have less to eat. Then the big cats eat livestock, and the herders kill the leopards to protect their livelihoods.

5. Agencies are working to save the cats and help herders at the same time. Some agencies give herders wire mesh and wood to keep snow leopards from entering their stables at night. Some pay herders for the animals they lose to snow leopards. In exchange, the herders stop killing snow leopards and leave more room and plants for the wild goats and sheep. 

6. Are the conservation programs working? Researchers estimate that only 3,500 to 7,500 snow leopards are alive today. But they need more reliable ways to count leopards before they will know.

7. That's where scientists like Dr. Kyle McCarthy are needed. He traveled to Kyrgyzstan to test ways of estimating snow leopard numbers. He camped in the mountains with Dr. Jennifer McCarthy (his wife) and other co-workers. They saw no leopards, but they hadn't expected to. Instead, they looked for evidence the cats left behind. ""You have to find something related to them: poops, scrapes (claw marks), and pee,"" Dr. Kyle. 

*McCarthy says*.

8. The group collected scat (poop) for DNA analysis. Along with the waste material of digestion, scat contains cells from the animal's own body. DNA is material inside those cells that, like fingerprints, can identify an individual animal.

9. The team also used automatic cameras. The scientists placed motion-and- heat-sensitive cameras along a mountain ridge. When a snow leopard neared one of these ""camera traps,"" the camera snapped its picture.

10. Each snow leopard's spot pattern is different. Researchers compared patterns in the photos to identify cats. The cameras had taken photos of 15 different snow leopards at two study sites.

*A Close Encounter*

11. Shannon Kachel, Dr. Kyle McCarthy's graduate assistant, has searched for snow leopards in Tajikistan, where he almost saw one. ""I was hiking along a ridgeline in the late afternoon and came around the corner of a rock outcropping to find a steaming, fresh kill site with snow leopard signs all round,"" Kachel says. ""I could see and hear where the cat had knocked some rocks loose as it ran away from me, but even though I waited until it was nearly dark, I never saw the cat."" 

12. ""Most people will never see a snow leopard, yet it has a right to exist,"" Dr. Kyle McCarthy says. ""Its too magnificent to think about losing.""",*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 7 through 12.*,"*Saving Snow Leopards*

2021-released-items-ela-g4,3,"""1. Long ago, in Australia, there lived a girl named Kanikiya. From the time she was small, Kanikiya loved to dance. She moved as gracefully as the brolgas, the tall, slender cranes that courted along the riverbank. The people in the camp would often see Kanikiya dancing down by the water, for she wore a scarlet ribbon around her neck, and it floated as she moved. People believed she danced like moonlight shining on the running river.

2. Dancing was fine for a young child, but by the time she was twelve, the people in the camp did not approve of such frivolity in a young woman. She should be working, they insisted. Only the youngest children danced away the day.

3. Kanikiya's mother, hearing disapproval around the camp, warned her that she must stop dancing. ""Remember the story of the lazy girl who would not work,"" she said. ""She turned into a dingo. The rest of her life she ran with packs of wild dogs, preying on sheep at night.""

4. Kanikiya, who knew the camp legends, shivered at her mother's words. Such tales frightened her. But she knew she wasn't lazy. It wasn't laziness that made her forget her work. The need to dance surged through her. She could not stop dancing any more than she could stop breathing. She feared that if she stopped doing either, she would die.
 
5. Flocks of silvery gray brolgas stopped near Kanikiya's camp during their migration in the spring and fall of each year. Then, more than any other time, Kanikiya would forget her work, steal to the river, and watch the birds dance as the day darkened. As if impelled by a strong, mysterious force, Kanikiya would join in their dance at the river's edge, her scarlet ribbon flying behind her. If only I could dance with the cranes all my life, thought Kanikiya as she trudged back to the camp, then I would be at peace. One spring evening Kanikiya's mother found her daughter dancing near the river before she had finished gathering cabbage palms for their evening meal.

6. ""I can do nothing with you, Kanikiya!"" her mother shouted. ""I have decided. You must not leave the camp until the brolgas have left. I feel they have powers over you that must be broken."" While her mother spoke, Kanikiya felt tears gather. She sensed the eyes of the brolgas upon her. Glancing up, she marveled as they dipped their heads and danced a slow, mournful dance. They understand my sorrow, Kanikiya thought, the knowledge warming her.

7. Her mother grabbed her arm, pulling her toward the camp. Within Kanikiya's heart something died as she left the river that evening. Plodding up the bank, she felt her life begin to ebb away. The next day, instead of going out to gather food, Kanikiya stayed in the camp. She wove baskets from the reeds the other children collected. Day followed day in a mournful blur. She couldn't eat. She wouldn't smile. The heaviness in her heart grew, and because of that she became weaker.As she worked, she listened to the happy calls of the brolgas and imagined herself dancing with them, twirling, dipping, and free. At night she danced with the birds in her dreams.

8. If only I could dance with them again, she'd think each morning upon waking, then I would find rest for my soul. Soon the call of the brolgas became too strong for Kanikiya to deny. One morning before dawn she heard them calling her. Slipping out of the camp, she rushed down to the riverbank to dance with the cranes. 

9. Just this one time, she thought as she whirled, her scarlet ribbon floating behind her. Just this once, then peace will visit me again. Later that morning, she was not found at her weaving. Her mother looked for her throughout the camp and, not finding her there, searched near the river.

10. As Kanikiya's mother neared the water, she found dozens of wild brolgas dancing and dipping to the sound of the wind in the trees. Fearful of their savage dance, she turned to go. But before she started up the path, she noticed one graceful crane in the center of the flock, a scarlet ribbon tied around her neck, dipping her head in greeting.""","*Directions Read this story.

2021-released-items-ela-g5,1,"""1. My mother believed in using things up. We always squeezed the toothpaste tube until it was as sharp as a razor, and we cleaned our plates, even when it was liver-and- onions night. . ..

2. Mom's frugality was legendary. She could make one chicken come back in a dozen meals as variously disguised leftovers. Her favorite saying was ""waste not, want not."" Josh and I weren't sure what that meant, but it probably explained why Mom was into recycling long before it became popular. It also explained why the ""Affair of The Hat,"" as it later became known, was so strange.

3. The Hat deserved capital letters. It was about three feet across, made of green straw and covered with big plastic daisies, two red peonies, and an orange bow. I might have said it was ""dog ugly,"" except that wouldn't sit well with our dog, Mutt.

4. Great-aunt Marjorie had given The Hat to Mother on one of her visits to our farm. It was supposed to keep the sun off Mother's delicate complexion while enhancing her rural beauty (whatever that meant)....

5. When Aunt Marjorie returned to the city, Josh and I held our breath to see what would happen to The Hat. We could see that Mom's thrifty nature and fashion sense were in pitched battle. She couldn't justify throwing The Hat away—it was nearly new and had a lot of use left in it—but neither could she stomach wearing it. She tried pulling off the daisies and peonies, but they were stuck on tight, as were the perky orange ribbons that held The Hat in place. She'd have to find some other solution.

6. One day Josh and I came down to breakfast and noticed that The Hat was missing from the hook by the door. We looked at each other, then scouted the house. It wasn't hard to spot. Mother had installed it in the parlor as a lampshade.

7. Our parakeet, Pete, chirped inquiringly from his cage as Josh and I decided to see how The Hat looked in full lampshade glory. We pulled the chain.

8. Pete tweeted once, then dropped like a stone from his perch. We ran to his cage, and Josh suggested mouth-to-beak resuscitation. Then we glanced over at the lamp. The light shining through the peonies made them look like two big red eyes glaring at you. No wonder Pete had fainted. We plucked The Hat from the lamp and went to tell Mom. Reluctantly she hung it back up on the hook by the door....

9. The next morning she headed out the door, The Hat filled to the brim with turkey feed. Josh and I watched as Mother approached the turkeys scavenging in the barnyard. The minute those turkeys sighted The Hat, they ran gobbling toward the barn door and dived in a panic into the haystack. Mom dumped the turkey feed in the barnyard and walked back to the house, her shoulders drooping....

10. She threw The Hat to the floor, raised her foot, and screamed, ""THIS HAT IS FOR THE BIRDS!"" Josh and I stepped back, waiting for her foot to come crashing down.

11. ""It is not for the birds,"" Josh blurted. ""They hate it!""

12. It was as though time stood still. Then we heard a strange sound. Mother was laughing!

13. We shook our heads. She'd finally gone over the edge—there she stood, one foot in the air, laughing like a hysterical flamingo.

14. Then she put her foot down ... on the floor. She picked up The Hat and headed upstairs where we heard boxes being shuffled around in the attic...

15. When she came down, she was dragging a body. It was wearing Grandpa's old overalls, Uncle Paul's flannel shirt, and the shoes Josh had outgrown last year. Its head was a flour sack, stuffed full of straw from an old tick, and on that head perched The Hat.

16. Mom hauled the stuffed body outside and set it up on a post in the middle of the cornfield. And that's where it stayed.

17. Our corn crop that year was particularly good. For some reason the birds steered clear of our fields and raided the neighbors' instead. Maybe it had something to do with our scarecrow, I don't know. All I do know is that from then on, we rarely saw crows on our property except during the month of June.

2021-released-items-ela-g5,2,"""1. In the days when farmers worked with ox and sled and cut the dark with lantern light, there lived a boy who loved snow more than anything in the world. Willie Bentley's happiest days were snowstorm days. He watched snowflakes on his mittens, on the dried grass of Vermont farm fields, on the dark metal handle of the barn door. He said snow was as beautiful as butterflies, or apple blossoms.

2. He could net butterflies and show them to his older brother, Charlie. He could pick apple blossoms and take them to his mother. But he could not share snowflakes because he could not save them.

3. When his mother gave him an old microscope, he used it to look at flowers, raindrops, and blades of grass. Best of all, he used it to look at snow. While other children built forts and pelted snowballs at roosting crows, Willie was catching snowflakes. Day after stormy day he studied the icy crystals.

4. Their intricate patterns were even more beautiful than he had imagined. He expected to find whole flakes that were the same, that were copies of each other. But he never did. Willie decided he must find a way to save snowflakes so others could see their wonderful designs. For three winters he tried drawing snow crystals. They always melted before he could finish.

5. When he was sixteen, Willie read of a camera with its own microscope. ""If I had that camera I could photograph snowflakes,"" he told his mother. Willie's mother knew that he would not be happy until he could share what he had seen.

6. ""Fussing with snow is just foolishness,"" his father said. Still, he loved his son. When Willie was seventeen his parents spent their savings and bought the camera. It was taller than a newborn calf, and cost as much as his father's herd of ten cows. Willie was sure it was the best of all cameras.

7. Even so his first pictures were failures—no better than shadows. Yet he would not quit. Mistake by mistake, snowflake by snowflake, Willie worked through every storm. Winter ended, the snow melted, and he had no good pictures. He waited for another season of snow. One day, in the second winter, he tried a new experiment. And it worked! Willie had figured out how to photograph snowflakes! ""Now everyone can see the great beauty in a tiny crystal,"" he said.

8. But in those days, no one cared. Neighbors laughed at the idea of photographing snow. ""Snow in Vermont is as common as dirt,"" they said. ""We don't need pictures."" Willie said the photographs would be his gift to the world. While other farmers sat by the fire or rode to town with horse and sleigh, Willie studied snowstorms. He stood at the shed door and held out a black tray to catch the flakes.

9. When he found only jumbled, broken crystals, he brushed the tray clean with a turkey feather and held it out again. He waited hours for just the right crystal and didn't notice the cold. If the shed were warm the snow would melt. If he breathed on the black tray the snow would melt. If he twitched a muscle as he held the snow crystal on the long wood pick the snowflake would break. He had to work fast or the snowflake would evaporate before he could slide it into place and take its picture. Some winters he was able to make only a few dozen good pictures. Some winters he made hundreds....

10. But his snow crystal pictures were always his favorites. He gave copies away or sold them for a few cents. He made special pictures as gifts for birthdays. He held evening slide shows on the lawns of his friends. Children and adults sat on the grass and watched while Willie projected his slides onto a sheet hung over a clothesline.

11. He wrote about snow and published his pictures in magazines. He gave speeches about snow to faraway scholars and neighborhood skywatchers. ""You are doing great work,"" said a professor from Wisconsin. The little farmer came to be known as the world's expert on snow, ""the Snowflake Man."" But he never grew rich. He spent every penny on his pictures. Willie said there were treasures in snow. ""I can't afford to miss a single snowstorm,"" he told a friend.

2021-released-items-ela-g5,3,"1. In a valley in the highlands of Scotland, there once lived a young tenant farmer, Gregor, and his widowed mother. Although they worked hard, they could never accumulate enough money to buy the flock of sheep they longed to have, for their small parcel of land produced only modest amounts of oats and barley To make matters worse, MacTavish, the owner of this and many other crofts, always found reasons not to pay the farmers all they had earned....

2. When he opened the door each morning and looked out, he saw MacTavish's house on top of a mountain, a magnificent stone mansion surrounded by red, pink, and violet rhododendrons. Gregor often climbed the slope and stood outside the iron gates, wondering what fine furnishings and delicious foods lay within. Neighbors claimed that MacTavish owned many houses and even kept a chest of gems under his bed. As Gregor, his mother, and their neighbors grew gaunt and pale with hard work and not enough food, they railed against MacTavish, who had swindled all of them at one time or another.

3. One day, as Gregor listened to the bagpipe music that drifted from the open windows of MacTavish's mansion, he had an idea. That night, when his mother was asleep, he emptied the jug that held their money and counted it. After putting back a few coins for food, he put the rest in his pocket. The next morning, he hurried to the market, where he went from farmer to farmer, asking the prices of sheep for sale. Gregor found many handsome animals, but they were all too expensive. When he reached a stall with scrawny and sickly sheep, the owner beckoned to him....

4. Gregor shook his head and began to walk away. The man grabbed his sleeve and whispered in his ear, ""This one will make her owner rich!"" Gregor examined the old sheep with spindly legs and dirty, unkempt wool—the worst of the lot. ""If she will make me rich,"" said Gregor, ""how is it that she has not done so for you?""

5. The man paused, thinking. ""I have not had her long enough!""

6. ""Nonsense,"" said Gregor, but he gave the man his money and led the pitiful animal home.

7. When his mother saw what he had bought with their money, she burst into tears. ""My foolish son, what have you done? Now we will starve, and no one will help us!""

8. ""Do as I say, Mother, and we will be rich. I promise.""

9. She wanted to believe him. Wiping her eyes with her ragged sleeve, she asked what he wanted her to do.

10. ""Go to market and tell everyone that your son has a sheep that will make whoever owns her rich,"" said Gregor.. . .

11. One morning, a carriage arrived. Two servants opened the door and a stout, well- dressed gentleman emerged. His Tartan kilt was made of the finest wool, his ascot was pure silk, and his shoes had silver buckles. On his fat fingers were eight gold rings, and his pomaded hair glistened in the sun. It was MacTavish!

12. Gregor bowed as if to royalty. MacTavish looked at him sternly. ""I have come to rid you of the unfortunate sheep that everyone is talking about,"" said MacTavish, opening his sporran. ""I can pay your price and I will have her, even though she has done nothing for you, I see."" MacTavish sneered at Gregor.

13. Gregor hugged Dear One. ""I will not sell her to you!""

14. At that, MacTavish, whose servants were helping him into his carriage, turned and marched back. ""I will pay anything,"" he said. ""Name the price.""

15. Gregor was ready. ""That,"" he said, pointing up to the mansion above them. ""I will have the dwelling and everything in it—furniture, utensils, even the chest of gems under your bed."" 

16. ""Done,"" said MacTavish.

17. The next day, Gregor and his mother moved into the mansion that had once belonged to MacTavish, and MacTavish brought Dear One to the market so that all might see he could indeed own anything he wanted. Then MacTavish and the sheep rode away in his carriage to another of his houses in a valley beyond the mountains.

18. After months had passed and the sheep had done nothing to increase MacTavish's riches, he realized he had been swindled. Furious beyond speech, he returned to the mansion, but Gregor would not open the gates.

19. ""I have been cheated!"" shouted MacTavish.

20. ""You have not been cheated,"" said Gregor. ""I was the owner of the sheep, and she has made me rich, hasn't she?""

21. ""Yes, but...,"" sputtered MacTavish.

22. ""Then you got what you paid for."" Gregor turned and walked away.

23. Soon afterward, Gregor sold the chest of gems and bought the huge flock of sheep he and his mother had always wanted. He shared the rest of his fortune with the other poor families of the valley who had been cheated by MacTavish.""",*Directions Read this story.

2021-released-items-ela-g5,4,"""1. ""Come,"" Wangari's mother called. She beckoned her young daughter over to a tall tree with a wide, smooth trunk and a crown of green, oval leaves.

2. ""Feel,"" her mother whispered.

3. Wangari spread her small hands over the tree's trunk. She smoothed her fingers over
the rough bark.

4. ""This is the _mugum, of_  her mother said. ""It is home to many. It feeds many too.""

5. She snapped off a wild fig from a low branch, and gave it to her daughter. Wangari
ate the delicious fruit, just as geckos and elephants did. High in the tree, birds chirped in their nests. The branches bounced with jumping monkeys.

6. ""Our people, the Kikuyu of Kenya, believe that our ancestors rest in the tree's shade,"" her mother explained.

7. Wangari wrapped her arms around the trunk as if hugging her great-grandmother's spirit. She promised never to cut down the tree....

8. When Wangari finished elementary school, she was eleven years old. Her mind was like a seed rooted in rich soil, ready to grow. Wangari wanted to continue her education, but to do so she would have to leave her village and move to the capital city of Nairobi. Wangari had never been farther than her valley's ridge. She was scared.

9. ""Go,"" her mother said. She picked up a handful of earth and placed it gently into her daughter's hand. ""Where you go, we go."" ...

10. As graduation neared, Wangari told her friends she wanted to become a biologist.

11. ""Not many native women become biologists,"" they told her.

12. ""I will,"" she said. 

13. Wangari watched sadly as her government sold more and more land to big companies that cut down forests for timber and to clear land for coffee plantations. Native trees such as cedar and acacia vanished. Without trees, birds had no place to nest. Monkeys lost their swings. Tired mothers walked miles for firewood....

14. When Wangari visited her village she saw that the Kikuyu custom of not chopping down the _mugumo_ trees had been lost. No longer held in place by tree roots, the soil streamed into the rivers. The water that had been used to grow maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes turned to mud and dried up. Many families went hungry.

15. Wangari could not bear to think of the land being destroyed. Now married and the mother of three children, she worried about what would happen to the mothers and children who depended on the land.

16. ""We must do something,"" Wangari said.

17. Wangari had an idea as small as a seed but as tall as a tree that reaches for the sky. "" _Harabee_ ! Let's work together!"" she said to her countrywomen—mothers like her. Wangari dug deep into the soil, a seedling by her side. ""We must plant trees."" ...

18. Wangari traveled to villages, towns, and cities with saplings and seeds, shovels and hoes. At each place she went, women planted rows of trees that looked like green belts across the land. Because of this they started calling themselves the Green Belt Movement.

19. ""We might not change the big world but we can change the landscape of the forest,"" she said.

20. One tree turned to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to one million, all the way up to thirty million planted trees. Kenya grew green again. Birds nested in new trees. Monkeys swung on branches. Rivers filled with clean water. Wild figs grew heavy in mugumo branches.

I sat in my pink-flowered swimsuit on the hot concrete of the driveway, my legs stretched out in front of me, my chipped pink toenails pointing to the sky I was reflecting on the brilliant defeat the boys had just suffered in yet another water fight with the neighborhood girls.

2. Looking down the driveway to the road, I felt the ground beneath me rumble. My legs began to shake, the leaves on the trees trembled, and I could swear that a flowerpot tumbled over on my neighbor's front porch. The intense rattling increased with every passing second.

3. I got up and started to run, my bare feet smacking against the scalding pavement. I had to hide until I found an excuse. Something, anything, to get me out of it.

4. ""Paige,"" I heard my mom call from the front door, ""come inside. Your grandparents just pulled up.""

5. ""Rats,"" I whispered. Slowly, I turned around and walked back with my head down, looking at the pavement.

6. When I got to my driveway, I looked up and saw the familiar sight. It was a monster, a big white monster, complete with an ""I Love Fishing"" bumper sticker. The shadow it made almost covered the entire driveway. But the real problem sat behind the white monster. It looked harmless at first, but I had already spent too many boring afternoons in it this summer. It was a little red fishing boat, my grandpa and grandma's pride and joy.

7. I walked inside the house where my grandparents and my mom were standing around the island in the kitchen. I gave both of my grandparents a hug and proceeded to the cupboard for a glass.

8. ""How ‘bout some fishing, Paige?"" my grandpa asked. ""Your two brothers are raring1 to go.""

9. This is what I'd been dreading. ""I don't know, Grandpa. It's pretty hot out.""

10. ""It's never too hot to fish. I brought the boat and everything. It's all hitched up behind the RV. I know how much you love riding in the boat.""

11. He was wrong. I hated that boat. I liked riding in boats when they were going fast. I liked riding in boats that I could water-ski behind. I'd even settle for tubing if skiing wasn't an option. But fishing boats hardly even moved.

12. ""We'll have to buy you a new fishing pole first. Your mom said you lost your last one,"" said Grandpa.

13. I seemed to lose a lot of fishing poles, but my grandpa never minded. He would just take me to Target to buy another one.

14. In twenty minutes, I found myself walking into the mouth of the monster, complete with pink interior from the dirt-covered floor mats to the darker pink seats. Behind the seats nestled a small kitchenette, littered with what was surely last month's breakfast: two plates covered with syrup, an old waffle box, an empty carton of eggs, and a basket filled with rotten fruit. Across from the kitchenette stood the bathroom, which contributed to the monster's bad case of morning breath. Beyond this was a small bed, piled high with pink blankets, resembling a tongue that could lash out at any time and swallow me whole.

15. Hanging neatly on hooks above the kitchenette counter were Grandpa's hats, white with stains, like teeth that hadn't been brushed in a while. They all had sayings like ""#1 Grandpa"" and ""King of the Sea."" Before he sat down in the driver's seat, Grandpa plucked the nearest hat off a hook and put it on over his bald spot to avoid burning his head in the hot summer sun.

16. My grandpa maneuvered the large RV and boat out of our neighborhood, and in ten minutes, we were at Raccoon River, placing the red fishing boat in the water. I was going to borrow an extra pole that my grandpa kept ""just in case."" Great.

17. In minutes, all three of us kids had our lines in the water. The sweat running down my body was already stinging my eyes and turning the fake leather seat beneath me into a wet, slippery mess. The breeze that may have made the summer heat bearable was nonexistent on the small lake surrounded by tall trees. It was going to be a long afternoon.

18. Three hours later, everybody else had caught at least two fish. The boat was once again attached to the back of the RV, and we were on our way home, a waste of another Saturday afternoon.

19. ""Wasn't that fun, kids?"" asked my grandpa as he peeked back at us through the rearview mirror.

20. My brothers both responded enthusiastically and then began arguing about who had caught the biggest fish. I continued to stare out of the RV window without answering Grandpa's question.""",*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 7.*,"*Excerpt from Last Regrets*

2021-released-items-ela-g6,2,"""1. Think about how much time you spent outside last week. Really ""outside."" Walking from the car into the mall doesn't count.

2. Now think about how much time you spent indoors—on the Internet or playing video games or watching TV.

3. ""I play inside more than outside,"" says Casey M., of South Bend, Ind. ""I like to play games on the computer.""

4. If you're like Casey and many other people, it's likely that you spent more time inside four walls than outside in fresh air. Kids today spend two fewer hours per week on sports and outdoor activities than kids did 20 years ago. That's according to a University of Michigan study. Sedentary (nonmoving) activities are more popular. Most people in the study reported spending most of their free time watching TV (85 percent) or playing computer games (81 percent). The costs ""include obesity, greater stress, higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses—and less joy in being alive and aware,"" says _Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder._

5. So why is this happening? And what can you do about it? 

*Why Play? Why Outside?*

6. Play is important, even for adults. Goofing around relieves stress and lets us feel free and creative. And playing outside is especially good. Just being exposed to the great outdoors does wonders. ""Outside light is ... vital to the immune system and simply makes us feel happier,"" Pica says.

7. Plugged in and missing out? Here are four great reasons to get outside and play.

8. *Outdoor activity expands your senses.* Try this: The next time you sit down to IMTh1 your buddies, take note of your senses during and after your session. Then do the same experiment after you've done something outside.

9. Which makes you feel better?

10. Being outdoors brings the senses to life. In fact, 75 percent of students polled by Weekly Reader said they felt better after spending time outside. ""Hiking, exploring, and fishing help hone all of your senses,"" says Betsy Keller. She's a professor of exercise and sports sciences at Ithaca College in New York. ""Smell, sight... [they're] all engaged when you're outside.""

11. Bonus! With your senses engaged, you'll feel free and more creative. Clements reports that in a park near her home, young people turned a concrete slab into their own outdoor theater. ""They're role-playing ... enjoying the creativity and imagination that you can't when you're indoors,"" she says.

12. *Playing outside helps your body.* Want to get fit? Go outside! ""The outdoors is the best place for [you] to practice and master physical skills and to experience the pure joy of movement,"" says Pica.

13. You've probably heard teachers and others tell you that getting 30 minutes of exercise a day or walking 10,000 steps helps you stay fit. ""We've emphasized physical activity levels and not focused on the fun aspect,"" Keller admits. But if you're having fun, you're more likely to stick with it, and being outside offers special fun and fitness. When playing outside, says Keller, ""the terrain varies. You can be on stairs, hills, walls, play equipment. It challenges your balance, coordination, and stamina. Playing on a flat floor doesn't always do that.""

14. Time spent outdoors pays off later too. It helps keep your body's clock on track so that you sleep better at night and feel less sleepy during the day.

15. *Outdoor play eases your mind. Are you stressed out?* Having trouble concentrating? Too much time indoors—away from the natural world—may be a cause. Louv uses a term to describe the set of problems caused by too much time indoors: nature-deficit disorder. ""I use it not as a medical diagnosis,"" he says. ""I use it to describe the price we pay for being so separated from nature.""

16. *Spending time outdoors brings you closer to the environment.* Hearing the leaves crackle underfoot and breathing in fresh air builds awareness and appreciation of the environment. If you walk through the woods in search of cool birds and plants, you may find your mind expanding.

17. No woods nearby? You don't need a huge park to enjoy nature's benefits. Nature can be as close as your own backyard or that clump of trees at the end of the street. There are bits of nature everywhere—even in cities. ""Some naturalists call that ‘nearby nature,""' Louv says. ""It's a great way to experience a piece of the natural world without wandering too far from home.""  

18. So the next time you sit down to spend quality time with a video game, consider treating yourself to a little outdoor play instead. It's not called the great outdoors for nothing.""",*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 8 through 14*,"*Excerpt from Go Outside and Play!*

2021-released-items-ela-g6,3,""" 1. We had to board a second plane, smaller and bumpier than the last, which carried us south, along the western coast of the country. My heartbeat quickened as I peered out the window, down through the clouds at the blue waves tossing and turning below us. My first glimpse of the ocean.

2. ""Your grandmother will be so pleased to see you, Rakhee. Do you remember her— your Muthashi?"" Amma asked over the whir of the engine.

3. I did remember Muthashi, my grandmother. She had come to stay with us in Minnesota when I was around three or four. I could not recall the exact details of her face, but I had a vague mental picture of a slight woman draped in white who used to sit me on her knee and sing a song in Malayalam about ants.

4. I used to run out onto the driveway humming the ant song, and guide a string of the black insects into my palm. Weaving my fingers together and making a delicate cup with my hands, I would transport them into the house, giggling as the ants tickled inside their little cage. Muthashi would always act so pleased when I proudly deposited the squirming ants into her outstretched hand, although I'm sure she would let them out the back door as soon as I wasn't looking.

5. ""Rakhee,"" continued Amma. ""I haven't told you much about our family, have I?""

6. I shook my head.

7. ""Well, the Varmas are the most prominent, respected family in the village. My father was a doctor, and he started a hospital across the street from our home. He died a long time ago, so now my younger brother, Vijay, is in charge. You'll also meet my big sister, Sadhana, and her three daughters. One of them is about your age. And Vijay's wife, Nalini, who I have never met, recently had a baby boy. Everybody lives together at Ashoka—that's the name of the house where I grew up. You see, in India families stick together under one roof. It's not the same as it is in America.""

8. This airport was not as crowded or chaotic as the one in Bombay, and the people seemed neater and more subdued. In the bathroom Amma changed into a buttercup-yellow sari and painted a red raindrop on her forehead1 with a bottle that she produced from her purse. ""I can't show up at home dressed like an American,"" she explained.

9. I loved seeing that transformation, from my regular mother who took the trash out every morning with a bulky coat flung over her nightgown to this wondrous creature. From the moment she put on the sari and released her hair from its bun so that it streamed down her back in a lustrous river, she appeared younger and somehow more natural.

10. ""How do I look?"" she asked, as she ran a comb through her hair.

11. ""You look beautiful, Amma,"" I told her honestly.

12. A compact man with a bushy mustache and a symmetrical crescent of sweat under each arm met us outside the airport, holding a sign with ""Mrs. Chitra Varma Singh and daughter"" printed across it in block letters. He led us through the thick heat toward a white car and loaded all our suitcases into the trunk. Amma and I both slid into the backseat. My legs stuck to the synthetic leather.

13. ""Are you hungry, molay?"" Amma asked me. ""We'll be home soon."" But she sounded absent, as if my hunger was hardly her main concern.

14. I stared out the window as we drove. Unlike the gray, arrow-straight highways I was accustomed to, here the roads were red and twisty. In the distance I could see groves of coconut trees, their green fronds waving against the sky like pinwheels. We passed forests of rubber trees and stretches of lime-green grassland that Amma told me were rice paddy fields. Wiry, mustachioed men with protruding rib cages spiraling down their torsos and white cloths knotted around their waists (""Those cloths are called mundus,"" explained Amma) were scattered here and there in the treetops, tapping the trunks and collecting sap in metal buckets.

15. At one point the driver stopped the car abruptly. I leaned over the seat and was shocked to see a cow blinking her long black lashes at me. The driver honked the horn and she took her sweet time ambling out of the way.

16. Soon after, I heard a dull thud and a hulking elephant rounded the corner, heading toward us, the tough black ripples of its trunk swaying to and fro.

17. ""Amma!"" I cried.

18. But Amma only laughed. ""It's normal for elephants to walk around on the street here, don't worry.""  

19. A man wearing a faded blue turban and carrying a gnarled stick was riding atop the great animal. I waited for either the turbaned man to steer his charge out of the way or for the car to slow down, but neither thing happened. The driver pushed forward with alarming speed, straight toward the elephant. I gasped, but at the last second he swerved, and both he and the man nodded politely to one another, as if this were perfectly normal. The elephant lumbered past the car window so close that I could have reached out and brushed my fingers against its sagging hide.""","*Directions Read this story.

2021-released-items-ela-g6,4,"""1. The only difference between a lightning bolt and the small spark that jumps between your hand and a metal doorknob after you scuff across a rug is size. Both happen when electrical charge builds up and suddenly discharges.

*What Is Lightning?*

2. Lightning begins inside thunderstorms. Updrafts of air lift raindrops from the bottom of the cloud into freezing air at the top. Downdrafts move ice particles lower, into warmer air. Negatively charged electrons build upon the falling ice as it passes the water droplets. In time, the storm cloud becomes negatively charged on the bottom and positively charged on top.

3. When the negative charge builds up enough, a huge number of electrons jump through the air, looking for something that conducts electricity: the ground, a tree, a lightning rod. We see that discharge as a flash of lightning.

4. Lightning zips along at 40 miles (64 kilometers) a second. The center of the lightning bolt is only about as thick as a pencil, but it packs so much energy that it can melt rock or metal and set wood ablaze. An average lightning bolt has enough electricity to run the appliances in your house for a couple of days. But all that electricity arrives at once, at 54,000 degrees Fahrenheit (30,000 Celsius)—six times hotter than the surface of the sun. It would melt anything you tried to use to collect it.

5. Thunder is the sound of lightning. Each bolt super heats the air around it to 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit (9,980 Celsius) in less than a second. The superhot air instantly expands, sending out a shock wave that we hear as thunder. The farther away lightning strikes, the deeper the sound of the thunder—and the longer it takes to get to you. That's because light travels much faster than sound. In fact, if you count the delay between the lightning and the thunder, you can tell approximately how far away the lightning is (about a mile for every five seconds).

*Lightning around the World*  

6. Between 1,500 and 2,000 thunderstorms are crackling and booming around the world at this very moment—scientists estimate that lightning strikes somewhere on Earth about 100 times every second. Where does it strike the most often? Lightning zaps the remote mountain village of Kifuka, in central Africa, nearly every day. There, air masses from the Atlantic Ocean collide with cooler mountain air, making lots of thunderstorms. The Himalayas are another lightning hotspot. In the United States, the best place to spot lightning is Florida. Warm air from the Gulf of Mexico banging into cool air from the Atlantic Ocean creates lightning almost daily across the Sunshine State.  

7. Places with very stable weather get the least lightning. The Arctic and Antarctica have almost no thunderstorms because their air is about the same temperature everywhere. Lightning is also uncommon far out over the ocean, away from land, for the same reason.

*Lightning Safety*  

8. Because of its unpredictability and power, lightning can be extremely dangerous. If you're caught outside during a lightning storm, don't stand under a tree or lie flat in the open. Instead, crouch down with your hands and your head tucked close (but not touching the ground) and your feet close together. This makes you less of a conductor for any bolts that strike near you. Rubber-soled shoes are no protection—if lightning can zap through miles of air, which is an excellent insulator, your favorite trainers1 won't stop it either.

9. If you can, try to get inside a car or building. You're safe inside the car because electricity will travel over the metal surface instead of through the interior. In buildings, stay away from metal faucets and telephones connected to the wall— lightning can travel through pipes and wires. Then, once you're safe inside, look out and enjoy the awesome beauty of Earth's electricity!  1trainers: British term for ""sneakers""",*Directions Read this article.

2021-released-items-ela-g7,1,"""1. Old Glory shimmies like she's dancing the jitterbug. That's what Grampa Gus calls his pickup truck, anyway, the one he's always driven, with GUS'S SALVAGE painted right across the doors. She (that's the other thing we've always called the truck, she, because Old Glory's a regular part of the family) jiggles so much, she tickles my stomach.

2. The cab's completely packed—my best friend Lexie's here with me, along with my neighbor Irma Jean. We're in a giant tangle on the passengers' side of the bench seat, our arms and legs weaving in and out of each other as we try to leave Gus enough space to drive.

3. Our voices sound like a whole playground as we squeal and squirm. Excitement
leaks out that way—in shrieks, like air slipping out of a balloon—the day before you get sent to a brand-new school.

4. ""You all are making more racket than a bunch of skeletons break dancing on a tin roof,"" Gus teases. But the low tones of his laughter tell me that he doesn't mind at all. I love Gus's belly laugh—it's so hearty, if it were a meal, it'd be chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy, and pumpkin pie for dessert. So I let a few funny-sounding squeals out on purpose, because I just want another serving.

5. Old Glory inches toward the gates of McGunn's Iron and Metal, a junkyard that Gus knows so well, he could walk through it blindfolded and never once bump his shin on anything. The junkyard stretches on for about fifteen miles. McGunn's takes everything: wrecked cars and old appliances and air conditioners and water heaters. An old plane even calls McGunn's home now, and the wings stand like a giant sloping island in the distance.

6. A junkyard might sound like an ugly old trash heap, but I've always loved the way the rust at McGunn's makes a pretty orange stripe against the blue sky, right where the earth and the heavens stand back-to-back, making the horizon line.

7. Gus waves at Mick McGunn, the owner, who has crazy black hair growing all over his arms and out his ears and across his face. It sticks out from under his red ball cap. It pours out from the top of his T-shirt. I wonder, like I do every single time I see him, if it gets tangled in the buttons on his shirts, caught around his watch.

8. ""Got yourselves a real beauty queen there,"" Mick says as he points to the El Camino attached to the winch1 on the back of Old Glory.

9. Micks right about the El Camino. It's a shell of what it used to be, missing its hood, and its engine, and all its doors. Even its seats and steering wheel are gone now.

10. But that makes it the perfect car for Gus, who's a trash hauler. Not a garbage collector, like the men who drive giant trash trucks through neighborhoods and pick up weekly bags of sour kitchen leftovers and old wadded-up homework assignments. Gus is the guy to call for big jobs. The guy who picks up your broken-down freezers or your junked cars. He'll take your old grills or your rusted patio furniture or even clean out the contents of your grandparents' shed, when they decide they're packing up their house and moving in with you and your parents. He does all of that for a fee, and then brings it to McGunn's, where he trades his hauls for even more scrap money.

11. It's amazing, I think, his ability to take something broken and worthless and turn it into a fold of green bills in his pocket. Everywhere Gus goes in our town of Willow Grove, people are slapping him on the shoulders, smiling, and thanking him for coming out and hauling off their eyesore of a lawn mower, or asking him to come by again and pick up the swing set their kids have outgrown.

12. There's something beautiful that happens to people when they get the burden of useless stuff lifted off of them. Their shoulders straighten, and they take fuller breaths, and they smile like they're marathon runners who have gotten their second wind. And that, in my mind, is another special power that belongs to Gus.

13. We all tumble out of the cab, and Gus steers Old Glory toward a yellow piece of machinery—it almost looks like a bread box built for a giant.

2021-released-items-ela-g7,2,"""1. You've got to get an early start tomorrow, but you're not sleepy yet. Blame your brain, at least in part.

2. Yet that same brain is still under construction. And much of that important work takes place on the night shift—while you sleep. Here's what's happening—and why it matters.

*Hello, Night Owl!*

3. Today's lifestyle is one reason for late bedtimes. Many teens don't finish with after- school activities, part-time jobs, dinner, chores, and homework until 10 p.m. or later. Add in some time for relaxing, and bedtime may not roll around until 11 p.m. or nearly midnight.

4. Those ""relaxing"" activities can actually delay sleep longer. Screens for television, games, computers, tablets, e-readers, and cell phones give off blue light. ""The brain reads that as daylight,"" says Kyla Wahlstrom, an expert on education and sleep at the University of Minnesota.

5. In response, the brain cuts back melatonin, a hormone that promotes sleep, explains public health professor Lauren Hale at Stony Brook University. Plus, time is limited. ""If you're doing more screen time, you're getting less sleep time,"" she says.

6. ""There are emotions involved in going online,"" Hale adds. Falling asleep can be harder if texts, chat, social media, or even sports reports excite or upset you. Caffeine from sodas and energy drinks makes matters worse.

7. Even without modern technology, though, teens shift their circadian rhythm. That's the daily cycle for sleeping, waking, and various other activities. In particular, the brain's pineal gland starts releasing melatonin later. That's the ""sleepy"" hormone.

8. Teens' time shift is a little like the jet lag you'd feel traveling from New York to Colorado. Until your body adjusts, you'd stay up later despite the time change. But teens' brains stay in that later time zone.

*Sleep Deprivation*

9. The rest of the world doesn't shift, however. So most teens must head to school before they've gotten the 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). And that's a serious public health problem.

10. For one thing, lack of sleep makes it harder to pay attention. When studies compared teens who had earlier and later school start times, they found that those who had more time to sleep did better in class. They also suffered fewer accidents in sports, driving, and other activities.

11. Adequate sleep is important for learning too. ""Basically at night the sleep processes all your information from the previous day,"" says Wahlstrom. She compares it to cleaning up a computer's hard drive.

12. Lack of sleep could hurt mental health. Studies have found an inverse correlation1 between teens' amount of sleep and depression and other mental illnesses. As sleep time went down, the risks for the mental illnesses went up.

13. Beyond that, sleep-deprived teens report more relationship problems and feelings of inadequacy. ""They just get overwhelmed,"" Wahlstrom says.

14. Having sleep cut short could curb the brain's processing of emotions from the previous day. For some reason, Wahlstrom says, ""The negative stuff hangs on longer."" Crankiness can result, especially if you don't feel well.

15. Other studies suggest sleep-deprived teens get sick more often. ""Our immune system is negatively affected by inadequate sleep,"" notes psychologist and academic affairs vice president Amy Wolfson at Loyola University Maryland.

16. Weight control suffers from too little sleep too. ""Hormonally, your body is saying eat more, eat more,' "" explains Hale. And because lack of sleep lowers impulse control, you're more likely to grab chocolate cake than celery.

17. ""You don't just think better and act better"" when you get enough sleep, adds psychiatry professor Mary Carskadon at Brown University. ""You look better."" One study found that the more sleep people got, the more likely people were to find them attractive.

*Under Construction*

18. Just as importantly, burning the midnight oil can interfere with brain development. When teens hit puberty, the number of long brain waves drops during non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep.

19. Neuroscientists Ian Campbell and Irwin Feinberg at the University of California, Davis, suggest the drop shows that the brain is pruning unnecessary connections between nerve cells. The brain loses some plasticity—the ability to adapt in response to injury or other big changes. But the process lets the brain mature. ""It will streamline your brain—make it a more efficient adult brain,"" explains Campbell.

20. Lots of issues remain for sleep researchers to explore. For now, though, studies are clear: Teens' brains need sleep!

21. In August 2014, the AAP urged high schools nationwide to delay start times to at least 8:30 a.m. Later starts can let teens get a bit more sleep when their brains really want it. Unfortunately, not all schools can or will heed that advice. And you can't easily change your body's natural circadian rhythm.""",*Directions Read this article.

2021-released-items-ela-g7,3,"""1. When Ohkwari came that evening to sit by the central hearth in the Turtle Clans section of the big longhouse, his uncle suspected that his nephew had something important to ask. So Big Tree continued to work in silence, giving his nephew plenty of time to collect his thoughts. It was fully dark outside now, and Grandmother Moon was looking down through the smoke hole overhead.

2. Big Tree picked up a burning coal from the fire with his fingers, lifted it unhurriedly, and dropped it into the wooden cup that he was making from a piece of hard maple. He had been working on that cup for two moons and it was almost finished.

3. Ohkwari watched carefully. He remembered two winters ago when he tried to pick up a coal as his uncle did, but only succeeded in blistering his finger-tips. Big Trees fingers were tougher than Ohkwaris, the callouses on them so thick that the glowing coal did not burn them.

4. It will be many seasons, Ohkwari thought, before I can do the things that my uncle can do.

5. Big Tree placed the glowing coal into the bowl of the cup and nodded to his nephew. Ohkwa'ri leaned forward. This job was one that he could do now. He could help his uncle finish hollowing the bowl by blowing on the coal through the thin hollow branch of a sumac. Ohkwari blew and the coal burned with a sound like that of a tiny storm wind, reddening the blackened wood, burning the hollow deeper. He moved the sumac branch as he blew steadily, puffing his cheeks in and out as he blew, making sure that the coal moved around the bowl evenly to make the inner shape of the cup just right.
His uncle raised a hand and Ohkwari stopped blowing. The coal, which had been the
size of the end of his thumb, was now a tiny spark. Big Tree took his sharp-edged scraping stone and used it to clean out the bowl.

6. ""This is good,"" his uncle said. ""Now I only have to smooth the inside and this cup will be ready to use.""

7. He held it up and both he and Ohkwa'ri admired it. The finely detailed handle was the long head of a bear. Big Tree had used his sharp flint knife to finish off the details of the bear's head at the front of the cup, even making marks that looked like the fur of the bear. Then he had blackened it in the fire to harden and darken it and make it look even more like a bear.

8. ""Who will be the owner of this cup, my uncle?"" Ohkwa'ri asked.

9. ""A man who needs it,"" his uncle replied with a smile.

10. Ohkwa'ri nodded. Every man owned a cup such as that, usually with some design on it which indicated his clan. Your cup, which would be hung from your belt, could be used for dipping up drinking water when you were in the forest.

11. Dipping water with a cup was a wise idea, for you could remain watchful and alert while doing this. If you had to lean down and drink with your mouth from the spring or the stream, an enemy or a dangerous animal could creep up unseen. You also could thrust the cup deep under the surface where the water was cleaner and colder. Then, when you were back in the longhouse, you could use your cup to dip soup from the pot when the food was ready and your hunger told you to eat.

12. Ohkwa'ri already had a cup of his own, a small one made of soft basswood that hung on his belt. But that cup was plain and chipped and it was not well carved. It was a boy's cup. It was useful, but it was better to have something that was useful and beautiful.

13. Ohkwa'ri put the sumac blowpipe back on the shelf above his uncle's bed. Like all things that would be useful to more than one person, it was kept in plain sight. That way, if anyone in the village had need of it they could simply take it and return it when they were done. Truly personal things—like Ohkwa'ri's stone with its two beautiful crystals—were kept out of sight in the bark boxes under everyone's beds. No one would ever look under another person's bed.

14. Ohkwa'ri came and sat back down by his uncle, who continued to work on smoothing the inside of the cup.

15. ""Uncle,"" Ohkwa'ri said, ""I think it is time for me to build a lodge.""

16. Big Tree continued to work on the cup without saying anything in response.

17. ""I do not mean that I think it is time for me to move away from my mother's hearth,"" Ohkwa'ri said. ""I know that it is still two or three winters before it will be time for me to do that, to go and live on my own. But I think that it would be good for me to make a little lodge and sleep in it some nights. It would be a good way to learn, a good way to make myself tougher and stronger.""

18. Ohkwa'ri's words were true. In another few winters he would be expected to move out of the longhouse, to no longer live near his mother. Then he would need to know how to care for himself. Every boy came to this time in his life when he was expected to go through a whole year of the hard training needed to be accepted fully as a man. He would find a place outside the village and build his own lodge, sleeping there every night. Although he could still return to the big longhouse and take meals with his family, he would truly be responsible for himself.""","*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 15 through 21.*

Laboulaye felt a ""genuine flow of sympathy"" between France and the United States and described the countries as ""two sisters"" Aware that the hundredth anniversary of the colonists' independence was just eleven years away, Laboulaye hoped to give the United States a special hundredth birthday present on behalf of France.

2. He decided that the gift should be a monument honoring liberty. Laboulaye explained that this monument would have a dual purpose. It would reinforce Frances bond with America. In addition, the gift would stress to Napoleon Ills regime that the French people were dedicated to the concept of liberty and equality.

*BARTHOLDI'S CREATION*

3. Bartholdi wrote that the seed for the Statue of Liberty was sown at the party that night. It is generally thought that Laboulaye's opinion influenced Bartholdi, who began thinking along the same lines. Nevertheless, actual plans for the monument did not begin for years. In July 1870, France declared war on Germany and the Franco- Prussian War began. Bartholdi served in the French Army, and art took a backseat as the sculptor fought for his country. By 1871 the war had ended, and Napoleon III had fallen.

4. Laboulaye and Bartholdi hoped that the time might be right for democracy to take root in France. They thought that creating the statue now might encourage others to see the value of such a system. Bartholdi is quoted as saying: ""I will try to glorify the Republic and Liberty over there [in the United States] in the hope that someday I will find it again here.""

5. At first no one was sure what form the statue would take, but one thing was certain: If Bartholdi designed it, the monument was bound to be big. Nearly all of Bartholdi's pieces were created on a grand scale. Many people believed that the sculptor had been greatly influenced by what he saw when he visited Egypt. Impressed by the size of such structures as the pyramids and the Sphinx, Bartholdi longed for a sense of massiveness in his own work. His first public monument—commissioned when he was just eighteen —was a 12-foot (3.7 m) high statue of one of Napoleons generals. Workmen had barely
been able to remove the larger-than-life sculpture from Bartholdi's studio. Yet the work received a good deal of praise and helped establish its creator's reputation as an artist.

*FINDING THE RIGHT PLACE*

6. Bartholdi was excited about doing a sculpture for the United States. To explore how the Americans would feel about it, Bartholdi headed for the U.S. in the summer of 1871. He hoped to drum up enthusiasm for the project as well as find an appealing location to display the work. Bartholdi spent most of his days on the voyage making sketches of different views of Lady Liberty. The sculptor had also brought along a small model of the proposed monument to give Americans a better idea of how the finished product would look.

7. Bartholdi did not have to look very far to find the perfect spot for Lady Liberty. He spied the ideal place for her as soon as his ship entered New York Harbor. It was Bedloe's Island, one of a group of small islands in the harbor. At one time, the Mohegan Indians had called the island Minnissais, which means ""Lesser Island,"" because it was so small. Despite its small size, the island seemed perfect for the project because New York Harbor was an active seaport where this tribute to liberty would get the attention it deserved. The French sculptor further described the location as a place ""where people [immigrants] get their first view of the New World."" He wanted them to see the statue before anything else.

*SELLING THE IDEA*

8. Finding a suitable site for the monument was just one phase of Bartholdi's mission. Creating a sense of enthusiasm for the statue among Americans proved to be much more difficult. Laboulaye had supplied the young sculptor with letters of introduction to a number of important Americans. Bartholdi met with President Ulysses S. Grant and American literary figures, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, to talk about the project.

9. Although Bartholdi managed to pique the curiosity of some Americans, few appeared very enthusiastic. While the statue was to be a gift from the French, Americans would have to help finance it. Most of the people Bartholdi spoke to were not especially anxious to part with their money to make his dream come true. When Bartholdi returned to France, both he and Laboulaye agreed that they were not ready to begin construction.

10. The two Frenchmen made another attempt to get financial backing for the monument in 1874. They proposed dividing the cost of the monument between France and the United States. France would pay for the statue itself, while America was to pay for its pedestal and foundation. To speed things along, in 1875 Laboulaye formed the Franco-American Union, which included people from France as well as the United States. This organization worked to bring in donations on both sides of the Atlantic.

11. Though the original goal of completing the statue for the hundredth birthday (July 4, 1876) of the United States seemed unlikely, the group still did its best to meet that deadline. Appeals for donations for the statue appeared in the French press by the fall of 1875. The Franco-American Union proved quite creative in its fund-raising efforts. Banquets and balls were held in several French cities. The food and ballrooms for these occasions were donated, and all admission fees went to the statues fund. Bartholdi came up with just enough money to begin work on Lady Liberty.""

2021-released-items-ela-g8,1,"""1. Alan knew there was no way back to the base and no way the crew there could help him remotely—the other crawler was down for maintenance. He could go down this side of the stream for 23 kilometers, to a flat area where the flowing liquid would spread out and be shallow enough to cross; then go back 23 kilometers to the far side of the bridge. One problem: he would definitely run out of air before he got there.
 
2. Then Alan thought of the folded flight wings he had attached to his suit. Could he fly across the river and then walk to the base? Some quick calculations showed it wouldn't work. He had enough air, but the battery that powered the heater of the suit he wore to stay alive on Titan was only good for an hour, not the four-hour walk it would take to reach the base. Spacewalks were usually done trailing a power cable plugged in to the suit. The cable carried power from the crawler to supplement the suit's battery. Without the supplemental power, he would freeze solid in 10 minutes once the battery was exhausted.
 
3. Alan knew flying the whole way was impossible. Even with Titan's thick atmosphere and low gravity the suit made flying hard work, worse than running uphill carrying a sack of cement. No one could stay aloft for more than 10 minutes. It would be at least a half-hour flight to the base.
 
4. He needed more than wings alone to get back alive. Then it came to him. Bolted to the side of the crawler was a squat, black cylinder containing compressed nitrogen at 200 bar, compressed Titanian atmosphere in fact, used for cleaning gunk off the crawler's treads. Alan struggled with the bolts, working carefully in the searing cold with tools as brittle as glass. When he had the cylinder off, propped up, and pointing at the sky, he put his wings on, and then took them off, repeating the task until he could do it without thinking about it. . . .
 
5. He pulled the power cable out of his suit's hip socket and, before he could change his mind, gave a sharp tug on a line that he had attached to the valve of the pressure cylinder. The cylinder hissed like a giant snake, as high-pressure nitrogen blasted out, and then shot into the sky. A length of climbing rope he had attached to it went taut and snatched him into the air, where he was buffeted and tossed by the jet of nitrogen pouring down on him. It was like being caught under a breaking wave, pounded again and again by the surf. He was directly under the cylinder, using his weight and drag to keep the nozzle pointed down as the cylinder lofted him into Titan's sky. The ground beneath, blurred by the motion, made it impossible to gauge height or direction.
 
6. Time slowed; his shuddering world narrowed to the readout of the Titan Positioning System (TPS)—the icy moon's equivalent of GPS. Gradually, the pounding lessened as the rate of climb shown on the readout passed its peak and began falling. Alan waited. Just before it hit zero, he cut the rope. The cylinder, relieved of his drag, flew off, dwindling to a black dot and then disappearing into the empty sky above. Now he was coasting upward, propelled by the momentum imparted to him by the nitrogen rocket. He was high in the air, but already he was slowing under the drag of the thick atmosphere. He had to get the wings on before the downward fall began. Once he started to move with some speed, he would begin to spin and never get them on. The first wing stuck and he had to take his arm out of the loops and try again. . . .
 
7. He was gathering speed on his way down before he got the second one on. He spread his wings and rolled into a comfortable position, soaring over the moon's dimly lit surface. The TPS showed that he was heading away from the base. He banked in an easy curve and settled on a course for home. All he had to do was hold the wings rigid and enjoy the ride. He took an occasional flap, just for fun. . . .
 
8. As Alan glided toward the base, he flapped more often, watching the height-above-surface and distance-to-target displays. As they unwound, an unpleasant feeling, like a trace of the frigid atmosphere outside, crept into his stomach. His elevation was dropping dangerously, with over three kilometers left to go on distance-to-target. He could see details on the surface more clearly now, because he was flying so low. . . .
 
9. Alan forced himself to stay calm. Panic would mean disaster. He started flapping his wings faster, faster, faster. . . . He could feel himself lifting with every beat of the massive appendages. Faster, faster, faster. . . . His descent rate began to slow, but the muscles in his arms burned with pain. . . .
 
10. Time stretched out endlessly.
 
11. *The* TPS buzzed loudly in his helmet. Target. The station's beacon was directly below him. He could barely feel his arms, but something made them stop flapping. He gratefully fell out of the sky, wrapped in a ball of pain, with barely the strength to flare his wings one last time for a soft landing. . . .
 
12. Then he saw someone running toward him with a power cable in hand. Voices boomed into his helmet. It sounded like the whole station was in the control room waiting to see if he had made it.
 
13. ""Alan! ALAN! Say something! Can you move? Are you receiving this?"" He recognized the voice of the base leader. . . .
 
14. As the crew lifted him carefully onto a stretcher, he looked up at Titan's hazy sky. _I flew for my life today, he thought. I survived, That's the only record that matters_. ""","*Directions Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 7.*

2021-released-items-ela-g8,2,"""1. By the twentieth century, New York City had long since reached its destiny of becoming the most powerful city in America. In less than 300 years it had grown from a tiny Dutch outpost in the wilderness to the business capital of the world. It was a city built on dreams.

2. But it was made out of bricks and cement that had come from the banks of the Hudson. The river which had fed all those dreams was now fading into the background. New York didn't seem to need the river anymore, except as a sewer. And that's what it became.

3. Industry on the river had made some New Yorkers filthy rich. But it had just made the river filthy. Garbage, factory waste, plant chemicals and the raw sewage of the cities and towns along its banks were dumped directly into the river. The water turned greenish brown, except by the GM plant, where it turned red or yellow or whatever color they were painting the cars that day.

4. The fishing industry collapsed. The few fish that survived were too poisonous to eat. Smog from the factory smoke and dust from the cement plants blanketed the valley. And it was all legal.

5. Most people don't start out with dreams of polluting a river. But it was often the result of people chasing their dreams of wealth with little care of how they reached it. The Hudson Valley had always drawn them.

6. But now there were other dreamers in the valley, with their own dreams of wealth. They dreamed of the wealth of wildlife in a healthy forest, the abundance of fish in oxygen-rich water, and the great fortune of living in a beautiful river valley.

7. So perhaps it was a matter of time before the two types of dreamers would meet each other—in court. 

8. In 1963, Con Edison, New York City's power company, proposed a plan for constructing the largest hydroelectric pumping station ever built. The plan called for carving out a gigantic hole in the side of majestic Storm King Mountain on the Hudson River.

9. But then they met Franny Reese. Franny was a longtime valley resident with a simple point to make: the mountain could not speak for itself. If she didn't speak for it, who would?

10. Franny and a group of like-minded people founded Scenic Hudson and took on the power company in a landmark court case. Con Ed challenged the right of private citizens to participate, but the court sided with the citizens, in the ruling now known as the Scenic Hudson Decision.

11. After dragging out the case for seventeen years, Con Ed finally gave up and Storm King survived unblemished. It was the beginning of the environmental movement in this country, and once again, the Hudson Valley was the birthplace.

12. More and more people joined the movement as they realized how much difference each of us can make.

13. The love of their land was still alive in the hearts of Americans, and now that it was aroused again, things began to change.

14. Many new laws and new citizens' groups have been inspired by those early heroes of the environment, and their work has begun to bring the Hudson back to life.

15. The Mahicans called it ""The River That Flows Both Ways."" Slowly we are learning that taking care of the river is the only way that the river can take care of us.

16. Fifty years have passed since I dreamed of going to New York to see the river that shares my name, and thirty-five years since that dream came true. I live in the Hudson Valley now, grateful to all those who came before me, following their dreams to this river, building this nation, sharing its beauty, securing its future.

17. It's now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come.""","*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 8 through 14.*

2021-released-items-ela-g8,3,"""1. ""Homework?"" My mother mouths the word exaggeratedly, eyebrows raised, and I roll my eyes. Frowning, she points with her chin to the side door that leads to the stairs. I roll my eyes again, mouthing, Okay, okay, not needing her to pantomime further what she wants me to do. I hate the thought of leaving the clattering nerve center of the restaurant to wrestle with my trigonometry homework in my mother's quiet office downstairs.

2. ""Order!""

3. The bright lights and swirl of noise and motion are muffled as the kitchen door swings closed behind me.

4. It's hard to remember a time when the restaurant hasn't been the center of our lives. Mom used to be a copy editor and wrote food features for our local paper, the Clarion, and she met Pia when she did a write-up on the culinary school Pia attended. Pia thinks it was fate that Mom wanted to invest in a restaurant at the same time Pia wanted to buy the old bank building.

5. La Salle Rouge doesn't serve much in the way of ""kid"" food, since the menu doesn't cater to people my age on a cheap date, but I've loved everything about it from the first. I started experimenting with being a vegetarian when I turned fourteen, but Pia still found things to feed me and taught me to be creative with vegetables and tofu. I like to think I'm the best-fed vegetarian in the state of California.

6. Pia's been really good about teaching what she knows, and I decided early on that this is the work I want to do—get out of school and get into the kitchen for good. Mom and Pia have created a popular French-Asian-Californian fusion restaurant that has gotten great reviews from food critics. They took the best of each other's tastes— Mom's traditional Southern flavors and Pia's French training combined with her vegetable- and spice-savvy Cambodian tastes—and pulled off what one food critic called ""stylized food with unique flavor combinations in an intimate setting.""

7. Whatever that means. 

8. Three years ago, when I started high school thirty pounds heavier than everyone in my class, Mom and I came up with a light menu for La Salle Rouge, and it's been such a popular idea that Mom lets me come up with tasty, low-calorie desserts, which is one of my favorite things to do. It hardly seems fair that I have to walk away from all of that just to do trigonometry, but my mom says I have to finish school before I concentrate on cooking. She says it's smarter to have a ""backup plan,"" and she's made me apply to plenty of colleges and check out business majors just in case I ever want to do anything else with my life. I guess that makes sense if you're anybody other than me. When I turn eighteen, I already know what I'm going to do.

9. First, I'm going to buy a plane ticket to D.C. and go to Julia Child's kitchen at the Smithsonian and leave roses. They don't let you walk through it, but somewhere—I don't know where—I'm going to leave a bouquet and a little note for her. Julia Child is my patron saint.  She's the queen of all reasons people can do anything they want in life. Saint Julia didn't start cooking until she was practically forty, and she went on to do TV shows and make cookbooks and be this huge part of culinary history. She never got too fancy, she never freaked out, and she was never afraid to try new things. I want to be just like her—except maybe get famous faster.

10. The second thing I'm going to do is buy myself a set of knives. Pia swears by this set of German steel knives she got when she graduated, but I've seen the TV chef Kylie Kwong use a phenomenal-looking ceramic knife on her show on the Discovery Channel. Either way, knives are what the best chefs have of their very own.

11. The third thing I'm going to do, after I get back from Washington and get my knives, is . . . get discovered. Somehow. I know I'm going to have to pay my dues, but I'm so ready for my real life to start. It's not something I admit to a lot, but my real dream is to be a celebrity chef. Do you know how many African American female chefs there aren't? And how many vegetarian chefs have their own shows? The field is wide open for stardom. Every time I watch old episodes of Saint Julia, I imagine that I have my own cooking show. The way celebrity chefs do it now, I could also have a line of cooking gear, cookbooks, aprons, the works. People would know my name, ask for my autograph, and try my recipes. All I have to do is finish my trig homework and get back into the kitchen.""",*Directions Read this story.

2021-released-items-ela-g8,4,"""1. Women's rights crusader Elizabeth Cady Stanton was in her eighties during the heyday of the bicycle, and no evidence exists to show that she actually ever rode one. But there was no better or more eloquent advocate for women and the wheel. In 1895, Stanton contributed an article to the _American Wheelman celebrating this ""wonderful new style of locomotion_."" In the article, titled ""The Era of the Bicycle,"" she pointed out that cycling was increasing people's mobility, eliminating the cost of feeding and housing horses, and encouraging the building of good roads. However, she saved her greatest praise for the bicycle's effects on women. ""The bicycle,"" she wrote, ""will inspire women with more courage, self-respect and self-reliance and make the next generation more vigorous of mind and of body; for feeble mothers do not produce great statesmen, scientists and scholars.""

2. For all the practical benefits of the two-wheeler, the fact is that it brought about a
cosmic shift in women's private and public lives. With the rise of industry and the move from a rural to an urban economy in the 19th century, American women had become increasingly confined to their homes. Young girls could play outside, but when they matured, their freedom of movement was greatly restricted. ""At sixteen years of age, I was enwrapped in the long skirts that impeded every footstep,"" remembered Frances Willard, who in 1895 wrote a best-selling account of how she learned to ride a bicycle at age 53. ""I have detested walking and felt with a certain noble disdain that the conventions of life had cut me off from what . . . had been one of life's sweetest joys.""
 
3. While wealthier women were saddled with long skirts and restrictive corsets, those who were less well off worked anonymously in mills and factories. All in all, the result was the same. Except in a few instances, the public image of America was male. Politicians, soldiers, business leaders, and even the leading athletes in the new sports of baseball and football were all men. But the bicycle changed that. Suddenly, women were leaving their homes to cycle and socialize on country roads and city streets.
Bicycle racers such as Louise Armaindo and Frankie Nelson had their exploits splashed all over the papers. Bicycle manufacturers, intent on mining an untapped market, showed female models in their advertisements. Thanks to the wheel, women were starting to be seen and heard in public life.

4. It was not a stretch for some cyclists to see the possibility of a larger role for women in the world. When she conquered the wheel, Frances Willard was a former university president and the longtime president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which fought to prohibit the use of alcoholic beverages and to win women the right to vote. Willard saw parallels between learning to ride and learning to live. ""I began to feel that myself plus the bicycle equaled myself plus the world, upon whose spinning wheel we must all learn to ride,"" she wrote. ""He who succeeds, or, to be more exact in handing over my experience, she who succeeds in gaining the mastery of [a bicycle], will gain the mastery of life.""

5. For decades, Willard, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and many others, had been working toward increased political and economic rights for women. Now the bicycle brought a taste of independence to women on a very personal level, and some of them took the opportunity to express their discontent with old traditions and expectations. In August 1895, a cyclist named Ann Strong caused a stir when she compared the value of a bicycle to that of a husband in the _Minneapolis Tribune_. ""I can't see but that a wheel is just as good company as most husbands,"" she declared. ""I would as lief  talk to one inanimate object as another; and I'd a great deal rather talk to one that can't answer than one that won't."" Strong then contrasted the joy of cycling with the challenges of raising a family. ""You can make your wheel tidy over night,"" she said, ""and it never kicks off its shoes the very last minute, and never smears itself with molasses. When you are ready you can start. No little elbows are stuck in your ribs; there is no wiggling; screams at the cars or at the candy stores. You glide along, silently, smoothly, swiftly.""

6. Some stated the liberating effects of the bicycle with less sarcasm. ""The bicycle has brought to women a healthful, wholesome means of securing a degree of freedom and independence that no amount of discussion regarding ‘women's rights' would ever have produced,"" wrote the _L.A. W Bulletin and Good Roads magazine in 1898. Meanwhile, Munsey's Magazine_ assessed the impact of the wheel on women in a special bicycle-themed issue. ""If she has ridden her bicycle into new fields, becoming in the process a new creature, it has been gradually and unconsciously,"" the editors wrote.

7. ""She did not have to be born again in some mysterious fashion, becoming a strange creature, a ‘new woman.' She is more like the ‘eternal feminine,' who has taken on wings, and who is using them with an ever increasing delight in her new power."" Indeed, many bicycle companies at home and abroad did put wings on the women in their advertisements, emphasizing that they had taken flight.

8. Not all publications treated the emergence of the ""new woman"" with the same level of approval. Some mocked her, while others just seemed baffled by her. Her new way of dressing, in bloomers or divided skirts or skirts with shortened hems, certainly disturbed the old social order, but so did her confidence and daring. These traits led commentators to worry that the differences between the sexes were being blurred, a fear that was reinforced as the four newest states—Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho—granted women the right to vote in the 1890s. Would the bicycle help bring about a new kind of equality between men and women? Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her colleagues certainly hoped so. At any rate, the image of a female cyclist quickly became associated with efforts to win more rights for women""",*Directions Read this article.

32. *MS. CHEN*: Nelson, there's no reason to assume that Lucia has your book.

33. *NELSON*: But Ms. Chen, I lost this same book yesterday, and today Lucia is reading it. Don't you think that's strange?

34. *MS. CHEN*: No, and we should trust Lucia. This book is very popular. The library even has a waiting list for it. You can keep looking for your book after camp. Now please have a seat so we can start writing.

39. *NELSON*: I've searched the library a hundred times.

41. *NELSON*: [_Shaking his head_.] It's not in there, Dad.

42. *MR. LUND*: Why don't you look in your bag one more time? I'll hunt around here.

43. [Nelson _opens his backpack and takes out all his belongings, one by one. He turns the backpack upside down and shakes it. A book falls out_.]

44. NELSON: [_Shocked_.] Dad, the book was in my bag the whole time. Look, here. [Shows Mr. Lund the inside of his backpack.] The inside pocket is torn, and it must've slipped down into the lining of the bag. [_Sticks his hand in the backpack. Smiles. Then looks concerned_.] Poor Lucia was telling the truth all along. And Ms. Chen. She tried to help me.

45. *MR. LUND*: Well, tomorrow is a new day.

46. *NELSON*: You're right. I'll show the backpack to Lucia and Ms. Chen when I get to the library in the morning. I hope they'll understand and accept my apology.

2022-staar-may-grade-4-reading-releasedtest,2,"""1. It's a warm, sunny day at Garner State Park in Texas. A group of children crouch down near a dusty trail. The children are studying a strange set of footprints on the ground. One girl points at the toe markings. Meanwhile, a boy studies an animal-tracking guide. ""I think they belong to a turkey!"" the boy announces. The other children agree. They make a note in their journals. ""We're one step closer to our Junior Ranger badges!"" the girl grins. These children are participating in the Texas State Parks Junior Ranger Program. This program offers a fun way for children to discover and explore in Texas state parks.

*Junior Rangers across Texas*

2. In May 2013 the Texas State Parks Junior Ranger Program began. Thanks to the program, there are many Junior Rangers across the state of Texas today. This means that many children have learned how to take care of parks. This is good news for Texas state parks because there are nearly 100 parks in the state.

3 No matter where you live in Texas, chances are there is a state park close to you. There are park locations among mountains and canyons, in the desert, and along the seashore. Each park is rich with different animals, birds, rocks, flowers, and plants. No two parks are alike. Each park offers a unique experience for young explorers.

*Becoming a Junior Ranger*

4. It is easy to become a Junior Ranger. The program is completely free and is available to children aged 6 through 12. Children interested in becoming a Junior Ranger need the Junior Ranger Activity Journal. This journal is available at every state park. The journal describes the park and its history. Children can also read about the jobs of park rangers in the journal. It contains safety rules as well as information about how to keep the park beautiful.

5. In order to become a Junior Ranger, you must complete some of the activities in the journal. The number of activities is determined by your age. For example, if you are 8 to 10 years old, you may work on your choice of seven activities. You may choose to interview a ranger, explore a trail, complete a game, or answer questions about the park. If you are younger, you may complete fewer activities. If you are older, more activities are required to earn your badge.

6. No matter your age, when you have finished your activities, a park ranger will review the completed activities in your journal. (You may take the journal home as a souvenir!) Then, you will take the Junior Ranger pledge and promise to care for the park. You will also receive an official Junior Ranger badge. Each park has a different badge, so you can collect as many as you want!

*Helpful Tools for Junior Rangers*

7. Each time you visit a new Texas state park, visit the park headquarters. It is often located near the park's main entrance. This is where you can pick up a Junior Ranger Activity Journal. Some state parks offer Junior Ranger Explorer Packs. Children may borrow the backpack from the park headquarters.

8. The Junior Ranger Explorer Packs contain helpful items for a young explorer. The backpacks include binoculars, a magnifying glass, an animal-tracking key, a pencil, crayons, watercolors, and a sketchbook. The binoculars are especially useful for viewing animals from a distance. The animal-tracking key shows what different animal tracks look like. The key helps explorers figure out which animals have traveled on a path by looking at their footprints. The backpack also includes guides to birds, flowers, rocks, plants, and trees. The guides help children learn more about what can be seen at the state park.

*Spoken Like a Real Junior Ranger*

9. What's it like to earn a Junior Ranger badge? ""It's fun!"" says Molly Miser, who earned a badge at Stephen F. Austin Park. Ranger Bryan Hein, who awarded her the badge, agrees.

There was once a farmer who had a large field of corn that he harrowed and weeded with the greatest care, for he wanted to sell the corn and buy good things for his family with the money. But after he had worked hard, he saw the corn wither and droop, for no rain fell, and he began to fear that he was to have no crop. He felt very sad, and every morning he went out to the field and looked at the thirsty stalks and wished for the rain to fall.

2. One day, as he stood looking up at the sky, two little raindrops saw him, and one said to the other: ""Look at that farmer. I feel very sorry for him. He took such pains with his field of corn, and now it is drying up. I wish I might help him.""

3. ""Yes,"" said the other, ""but you are only a little raindrop. What can you do? You can't wet even one hill.""

4. ""Well,"" said the first, ""I know, to be sure, I cannot do much; but perhaps I can cheer the farmer a little, and I am going to do my best by going to the field to show my good will, if I can't do anything more. Here I go!""

5. The first raindrop had no sooner started for the field than the second one said:

6. ""Well, if you really insist upon going, I think I will go, too. Here I come!"" And down went the raindrops. One came—pat—on the farmer's nose, and one fell on a thirsty stalk of corn.

7. ""Dear me,"" said the farmer, ""what's that? A raindrop! Where did it come from? I do believe we shall have a shower.""

8. By this time a great many raindrops had come together to see what all the commotion was about, and when they saw the two kind little drops going down to cheer the farmer and water his corn, one said:

9. ""If you two are going on such a good errand, I'll go, too!"" And down he came. ""And I!"" said another. ""And I!"" And so said they all, until a whole shower came and the corn was watered, and then the corn grew and ripened—all because one little raindrop tried to do what it could.Public Domain",Read the next two selections and choose the best answer to each question.

Each one had a special talent, so Anansi gave each son a name that identified that son's unique gift. Anansi called his sons: River Drinker, See Far, Stone Thrower, Road Builder, Bubble Blower, and Puffy Pillow.

2. One morning Anansi told his sons, ""There's a treasure that glows behind the mountain. I am going to search for it.""

3. ""Good luck, Father,"" the six sons said.

4. That evening See Far was peering into the distance from a tall tree. Suddenly he shouted to his brothers, ""Father has fallen into a lake, and a fish has swallowed him! He needs our help.""

5. Instantly Road Builder built a silky trail that zigzagged like a lightning bolt through the trees. Then, the brothers charged down the path to the lakeshore.

6. ""But how will we capture the fish?"" cried See Far. ""It's hiding beneath the waves.""

7. ""That's no problem,"" announced River Drinker. He leaned over and gulped down the water. Soon the fish was flapping on the dry, sandy bottom.

8. ""But how will we get Father out?"" asked See Far. ""He's trapped inside.""

9. ""Watch me!"" declared Bubble Blower. He took a deep breath and blew into the fish. Seconds later a huge bubble floated out with Anansi screaming for help inside it!

10. However, before the six sons could catch the bubble, it floated into the sky.

11. ""Oh, no!"" gasped See Far. ""Father and the bubble have drifted into that thundercloud.""

12. ""I'll rescue him,"" proclaimed Stone Thrower. Carefully he aimed a tiny pebble at the thundercloud and then threw the rock into the cloud. Pop! Anansi plunged from the sky back toward the 
earth.

13. ""Father is falling!"" yelled See Far frantically.

14. ""Oh, no!"" said Puffy Pillow. In a flash, he lay beneath Anansi.

15. Plop! Anansi landed with a gentle bounce on Puffy Pillow's soft, springy back.

16. ""Thank you, my talented sons,"" Anansi praised. ""I wish I could reward you all with the treasure I discovered, but I only found one glowing white ball. How will I decide which son deserves it most?""

17. As Anansi considered his dilemma, he began to smile. Finally, with one tremendous toss, he hurled the ball into the darkening night sky.

2022-staar-may-grade-4-reading-releasedtest,5,"""1. Are you one of those people who loves listening to music? Do you listen to it whenever you can? If so, you're doing something good for your mind and body. If not, you should think about adding more music to your life. It just might make you happier, healthier, and better rested. It could even make you a better student.

*Music and Your Mood*

2. Music can make you smile, sing along, or get up and dance. These experiences are proof of music's power. In fact, scientists believe that music makes people happier. Valorie N. Salimpoor at McGill University has studied music and the human brain. She has proven that listening to pleasant music causes positive changes in the brain. These changes create feelings of excitement, joy, and pleasure. And those feelings make a person happy.

3. Two teams of researchers in Germany and Hungary have found something similar. They've shown that listening to enjoyable music can boost a person's mood. In other words, music can cheer you up when you're feeling sad. However, providing amusement is not music's only purpose. Music can also lower stress and help you worry less. That's according to scientists at the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, Washington. Their work has shown that relaxing music can calm people who are stressed or worried.

*Music Moves You*

4. Music isn't just good for your mind and mood, though. It's also good for your body. For example, a study called ""From Music-Beat to Heart-Beat"" showed that music can be used to treat different diseases. Music can also lower blood pressure, which is good for your health. What's more, music gets the blood pumping when you exercise. A group of scientists from Spain and Brazil have studied how music affects runners. The scientists found that people run faster and longer when they listen to music. Music can help you bike faster too. British scientists studied bikers who listened to music with a fast beat. The faster the beat, the faster the bikers rode.

*Music Helps You Sleep*

5. How else is music good for your health? It can help you get better sleep. That's according to a research study called ""Music Improves Sleep Quality in Students."" This study looked at college students who had a difficult time sleeping. Some of the students were told to listen to relaxing classical music before bedtime. Those students slept better and even felt happier.

*Music for Your Brain*

6. Still not convinced that listening to music is good for you? Then you might be interested to learn that music can help you learn. Scientists in Finland, England, and the United States have shown that music helps students. Listening to music can help you when you're learning something new. It can also help you better remember what you've learned. It can even help when you take a test, according to a British study. Students who listened to background music during a test answered more test questions. They got more of the answers correct too.

7. Music is more than just a pleasant art. It's a powerful force that can make our lives better. It can improve our mood, our health, and even our grades. In short, it's good for you. So make time for music, and you won't regret it!

2022-staar-may-grade-6-reading-releasedtest,1,"""1. For his 9th birthday a few years ago, Carter Steadman didn't want any presents. Instead, he asked for donations. He wanted to create a way station for monarch butterflies. ""It's a place where monarchs can stop and lay eggs,"" explains Carter, now in sixth grade.

2. With his parents' help, Carter cleared an area in his backyard in Virginia. Next, he planted rows of flowering plants called milkweed—monarchs' main source of food. Then he waited for the butterflies to come.

3. Every fall, millions of monarchs fly up to 4,800 kilometers (3,000 miles) from Canada and the United States to Mexico. There, the insects spend the winter clustered in trees in the mountains. In the spring, their offspring travel back north, stopping along the way to eat and reproduce.

4. This yearly migration is one of the most impressive in the animal kingdom, but its future is uncertain. That's why people like Carter are joining scientists to help the butterflies before it's too late.

*Super Voyagers*

5. Monarch butterflies live all over the world, from the Americas to Australia and India. But none journey as far as the monarchs of North America. ""Their migration is awe-inspiring,"" says Karen Oberhauser, a monarch researcher at the University of Minnesota.

6. These butterflies leave Mexico in March. They breed as they migrate. Females lay eggs across northern Mexico and the southern United States beginning a new life cycle. The older butterflies die, and their offspring continue north.

7. Over the summer, several more generations are born. In September, the youngest butterflies begin the trek back to Mexico. Many return to the same forests their great-great-grandparents visited!

8. But in recent years, fewer butterflies are surviving their trips. People are killing milkweed plants to make room for crops and lawns. More storms are toppling trees where monarchs spend the winter.

*People Power*

9. Luckily, monarchs have some important allies. Over the past 60 years, thousands of people have helped scientists study these incredible insects.

10. The effort began in the 1950s. Back then, monarchs' migration paths were unknown. But a butterfly scientist named Fred Urquhart had a plan. He and his wife, Norah, recruited volunteers across North America to track the monarchs.

11. These citizen scientists attached tiny stickers called tags to the butterflies' wings. Anyone who found a tag sent it back to Urquhart. The tags told Urquhart where each butterfly started out and ended up.

12. Today, people continue to tag monarchs through Monarch Watch, an organization based at the University of Kansas. Some citizen scientists also count monarch eggs and caterpillars. Others share photos online.

13. ""It's like a huge Easter egg hunt across the whole continent,"" says Elizabeth Howard. She founded Journey North, a website that tracks monarch sightings. ""We have everyone from kindergartners to the oldest scientists following the migration,"" she says.

*Gardens of Hope*

14. Reports from citizen scientists are extremely valuable. ""They paint a picture of how the monarch population is doing,"" says Oberhauser, the monarch researcher in Minnesota. Scientists have learned, for example, that monarchs are at risk of extinction within the next 20 years.

15. That's where kids like Carter and others can help. By planting butterfly gardens, they're restoring the habitat monarchs need to survive. ""Humans may be the problem, but we're also the solution,"" says Carter.

16. Over the past four years, Carter has raised and tagged more than 700 monarch butterflies. And he doesn't plan to stop anytime soon. ""If we're careful with our Earth,"" he says, ""monarchs will rebound, and we'll have a success story to tell.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

1. *THE NARRATOR*: Once there was a little baby ant. This ant loved to play outside and hardly ever came into the anthill when her parents called her.

2. [FATHER ANT _and_ MOTHER ANT _enter_.]

3. *FATHER ANT*: Now where is Hormiguita?

4. *MOTHER ANT*: You know Hormiguita. She is probably outside playing.

5. *FATHER ANT*: But ants aren't supposed to play. [_Yelling_.] Hormiguita!

6. [HORMIGUITA _runs in_.]

7. *HORMIGUITA*: What is it Papa? I was outside playing.

8. *FATHER ANT*: That is exactly what it is. Do you know what an ant's number-one job is?

9. *HORMIGUITA*: Uh, not really Papa.

10. *FATHER ANT*: An ant's number-one job is work!

11. *HORMIGUITA*: [_In a whining voice_.] Papa, work is so boring.

12. *MOTHER ANT*: Hormiguita, your father is right. As an ant, you need to help with the work of the anthill.

13. *HORMIGUITA*: Oh, all right. I'll start working.

14. *FATHER ANT*: That's what you said last time.

15. *HORMIGUITA*: I guess I really mean it this time.

16. *MOTHER ANT*: Good, because there is a big piece of food outside and you need to bring it in.

17. *FATHER ANT*: As soon as you've brought in the food, come find us and help with the digging. Now, I'm counting on you. Whatever you do, don't start playing and wander away from the anthill, because a big storm is coming.

18. *HORMIGUITA*: OKAY.

19. [_All exit_.]

SCENE 2: Outside the anthill.

20. *THE NARRATOR*: As soon as Hormiguita got outside, she forgot everything her parents had told her, and she began playing again. Before long, she had wandered away from the anthill.

21. [HORMIGUITA _enters—playing, chasing a blowing leaf_.]

22. *HORMIGUITA*: Wheeee! Chasing leaves is so much fun. A lot more fun than working . . . Oh my, I forgot I was supposed to bring that food into the anthill. [_She turns and starts to go back, but she stops and looks around because she is lost_.] I've never been in this part of the forest before.

23. *THE NARRATOR*: Hormiguita tried to find the way back home, but she was lost. As she stopped to figure out what to do, a large snowflake floated down from the sky and landed on her. The snowflake was very heavy and it trapped Hormiguita. No matter how hard she tried, she could not budge the snowflake.

24. *HORMIGUITA*: I'm trapped under a giant snowflake. Help! Help!

25. *THE NARRATOR*: Of course the snowflake didn't budge. Then Hormiguita noticed the sun up in the sky.

26. [THE SUN _enters_.]

27. *HORMIGUITA*: _Sol_, melt the snowflake until it gets off my leg, so I can go home.

28. THE SUN: That's too much work. I don't think so.

29. *HORMIGUITA*: That sun is too lazy and afraid of a little work.

30. *THE NARRATOR*: Then Hormiguita noticed a cloud in the sky.

31. [THE CLOUD _enters_.]

32. *HORMIGUITA*: Nube in the sky, cover the sun, until the sun melts the snowflake, until the snowflake gets off my leg, so I can go home.

33. *THE CLOUD*: Little ant, can't you see I'm playing. That's too much work right now.

34. *HORMIGUITA*: All that cloud wants to do is play!

35. *THE NARRATOR*: Then Hormiguita noticed the wind.

36. [THE WIND _enters_.]

37. *HORMIGUITA*: _Viento_, please help me. Blow the cloud in the sky, until the cloud covers the sun, until the sun melts the snowflake, until the snowflake gets off my leg, so I can go home.

38. *THE WIND*: That would be too much work, and I'm having too much fun now.

39. *HORMIGUITA*: I'm never going to get out of here . . . The sun, the cloud, and the wind are all too lazy to help me.

40. *THE NARRATOR*: Hormiguita was getting very discouraged. No one wanted to work to help her. And then the most amazing thing happened. Out of the earth came a little ground-spring of water, gurgling up to the surface.

41. *HORMIGUITA*: _jAgua!_

42. *THE NARRATOR*: The water melted the snowflake, until the snowflake got off Hormiguita's leg.

43. *HORMIGUITA*: I'm free!

44. *THE NARRATOR*: And with those joyful words, Hormiguita ran home.

45. [_All exit_.]

*SCENE 3: At the anthill*.

46. [FATHER ANT _and_ MOTHER ANT _enter_.]

47. *FATHER ANT*: Have you seen her at all?

48. *MOTHER ANT*: Not since the storm came in. Look, here she comes.

49. [HORMIGUITA _enters_.]

50. *HORMIGUITA*: Mama, Papa! I was lost in the forest and a big snowflake fell on me and I was stuck and—

51. *FATHER ANT*: Hormiguita, slow down. Where have you been?

52. *HORMIGUITA*: That's what I'm trying to tell you. I was . . .

53. [_All exit_, with HORMIGUITA telling them the story of her adventures.]

2022-staar-may-grade-6-reading-releasedtest,3,"""1. Artist Jason deCaires Taylor has created more than 500 life-sized sculptures of people. But you won't find them in a typical museum. Instead, Jason's works of art are on display in a most unusual place—they're under the sea!

2. Jason has created two underwater sculpture parks in the Caribbean Sea. The first, which features 65 sculptures, is located near the island country of Grenada. The second is in the National Marine Park of Cancun, Mexico. That one has 485 sculptures, the world's largest underwater collection of modern sculptures.

3. If you want to see Jason's sculptures up close, you'll need scuba or snorkeling equipment. Those of us who'd rather stay dry can hop on a glassbottom boat to get an overhead view of Jason's work instead.

4. But why anchor such beautiful sculptures in the sand 10 to 30 feet beneath the waves in the first place?

5. The idea is to draw snorkelers and scuba divers away from <u>fragile<u> nearby reefs. Thousands of people swim around those reefs each year, accidentally harming the reefs and the marine animals that live there. ""If people instead swim around the beautiful sculpture parks,"" Jason explains, ""it will give the reefs a rest.""

6. Seven-year-old Sam Clarke recently visited Grenada's underwater sculpture park. ""I wore snorkel gear, which has my mask and snorkel,"" Sam says. ""On my feet, I wore fins that helped me swim quickly.""

7. Sam says he was impressed by the many different statues. ""My favorite sculpture is _Circle of Children_. Standing together, 26 boys and girls are holding hands like they are friends under the sea.""

8. If you look closely at the faces of the sculptures, you will see that all of their eyes are closed. That's because the people who posed for the statues were covered from head to toe in a special concrete when Jason made the molds. The process took two loooong hours, so the models had to keep their eyes shut the whole time to keep the concrete out.

9. Marine life moved onto Jason's statues a couple of weeks after they were placed in the sea. Sponges began to grow on some of their faces, while algae, coral, barnacles, and seaweed grew on their bodies. The marine life then attracts fish such as lobsters, angelfish, sardines, turtles, and barracudas looking for food and shelter. Within six years, only the rough shapes of the statues will remain because undersea creatures will have completely covered them.

10. Does it bother Jason to see his artwork changing like that? ""No,"" he says. ""It's the part I like the most. Each visit is unique. Marine growth is taking on the role of the artist as it changes the sculpture.""

11. As for Sam, he loved his visit! ""Snorkeling in the underwater sculpture park is a good chance to get wet, see cool stuff, and swim with fish,"" he says. ""Oh, and there's a sculpture of a man on a bike. It's very funny seeing a man riding his bike underwater!""",*Read the next two selections and choose the best answer to each question.

2022-staar-may-grade-6-reading-releasedtest,4,"""1. Since 2010 hundreds of thousands of people have ventured into the Rocky Mountains. These travelers, however, are not there for the breathtaking views. They are searching for an antique box full of gold, jewels, and other valuables worth more than one million dollars. The man responsible for this hidden treasure is Forrest Fenn, a retired fighter pilot and former art dealer.

2. Fenn is a self-taught archaeologist and treasure hunter. He accumulated his treasure over a lifetime. Then one day he decided to use his riches as a tool to inspire others, rather than keep them for himself. He placed a 10-inch-by-10-inch bronze box of treasure somewhere in the Rocky Mountains between Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the Canadian border. He spent much time in this area treasure hunting. His hope was that hidden treasure would encourage people to be adventurous like he had been. He wanted to urge people to put down their electronic devices and go outside to appreciate nature.

3. Fenn's vision has come to life. While carrying their gear, travelers cross rough terrain. They travel over lakes, down cliffs, and through ice and snow. The difficulty of the task does not discourage them, though. The prize keeps them motivated. Some travelers have even looked for the hidden treasure dozens of times, but none have found it yet.

4. For now Fenn is the only person who knows where the treasure is. He says he has told nobody, not even his wife. Nevertheless, people continue to ask him to reveal its whereabouts. Fenn claims that he receives 100 emails a day regarding the treasure. Still, the location of the box remains a mystery.

5. Although Fenn declines to give the exact whereabouts of the prize, he has given clues. In a poem published in his memoir, _The Thrill of the Chase_, Fenn gives a <u>cryptic<u> message as to where the valuables can be found. Treasure hunters have carefully studied the poem, which has lines such as ""Begin it where warm waters halt"" and ""Not far, but too far to walk,"" in hopes of solving the puzzle.

6.Though the treasure has remained elusive, Fenn insists that it can be found. He wants people to continue to search. And while people may not find the box on their journeys, he hopes they will discover an even more valuable treasure—the beauty of the great outdoors.""",,*A Modern-Day Treasure Hunt*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Brazil the beetles have such beautifully colored, hard-shelled coats upon their backs that they are often set in pins and necklaces like precious stones. Once upon a time, years and years ago, they had ordinary plain brown coats. This is how it happened that the Brazilian beetle earned a new coat.

2. One day a little brown beetle was crawling along a wall when a big grey rat ran out of a hole in the wall and looked down scornfully at the little beetle. ""O ho!"" he said to the beetle, ""how slowly you crawl along—you'll never get anywhere in the world. Just look at me and see how fast I can run.""

3. The big grey rat ran to the end of the wall, wheeled around, and came back to the place where the little beetle was slowly crawling along at only a tiny distance from where the rat had left her.

4. ""Don't you wish that you could run like that?"" said the big grey rat to the little brown beetle.

5. ""You are surely a fast runner,"" replied the little brown beetle politely. Her mother had taught her always to be polite and had often said to her that a really polite beetle never boasts about her own accomplishments. The little brown beetle never boasted a single boast about the things she could do; instead, she just went on slowly crawling along the wall.

6. A bright green and gold parrot in the mango tree over the wall had heard the conversation. ""How would you like to race with the beetle?"" he asked the big grey rat. ""I live next door to the tailor bird,"" he added, ""and just to make the race exciting I'll offer a bright colored coat as a prize to the one who wins the race. You may choose for it any color you like, and I'll have it made to order.""

7. ""I'd like a yellow coat with stripes like the tiger's,"" said the big grey rat, looking over his shoulder at his gaunt grey sides as if he were already admiring his new coat.

8. ""I'd like a beautiful, bright colored new coat, too,"" said the little brown beetle.

9. The big grey rat laughed long and loud until his gaunt grey sides were shaking. ""Why, you talk just as if you thought you had a chance to win the race,"" he said, when he could speak.

10. The bright green and gold parrot selected the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff as the goal of the race, gave the signal to begin, and then flew away to the royal palm tree to wait for the end of the race.

11. The big grey rat ran as fast as he could until he thought how very tired he was getting. ""What's the use of hurrying?"" he said to himself, ""because the little brown beetle cannot possibly win—if I were racing with somebody who could really run it would be very different."" Then he started to run more slowly but every time his heart beat it said, ""Hurry up! Hurry up!"" The big grey rat decided that it was best to obey the little voice in his heart so he hurried just as fast as he could.

12. When he reached the royal palm tree at the top of the cliff, he could hardly believe his eyes. He thought he must be having a bad dream. There was the little brown beetle sitting quietly beside the bright green and gold parrot. The big grey rat had never been so surprised in all his life. ""How did you ever manage to run fast enough to get here so soon?"" he asked the little brown beetle as soon as he could catch his breath.

13. The little brown beetle drew out the tiny wings from her sides. ""Nobody said anything about having to run to win the race,"" she replied, ""so I flew instead.""

14. ""I did not know that you could fly,"" said the big grey rat in a subdued little voice.

15. ""After this,"" said the bright green and gold parrot, ""never judge any one by his looks alone. You never can tell how often or where you may find concealed wings. You have lost the prize.""

16. Then the parrot turned to the little brown beetle who was waiting quietly at his side. ""What color do you want your new coat to be?"" he asked.

17. Until this day, even in Brazil where the flowers and birds and beasts and insects have such gorgeous coloring, the rat wears a plain dull grey coat.""

2022-staar-may-grade-7-reading-releasedtest.pdf,1,"""1. Young people today rely heavily on digital technology. Text messaging and email allow people to effortlessly stay connected to others. Television and computer screens provide people with constant entertainment. Everywhere you look people are distracted by screens. Technology can be useful, but it is easy for someone to become too dependent on it. In fact, research has shown that the way young people interact with each other and with the world is rapidly changing due to digital overload. Staying connected has become so important that many young people find it stressful to be away from their phones. As a result, people have developed bad habits. They spend less time outside, get less sleep, and develop a shorter attention span. However, it is possible to achieve a more balanced relationship with technology. People should consider going on a ""digital diet."" 

2. When people think of a diet, they usually think about it in relation to food. There are some healthy eating habits you can develop, and there are bad eating habits. A digital diet helps promote developing healthy habits with technology. Developing healthy habits with digital devices looks different for everyone. But overall the main goal is to limit the amount of time we spend using digital devices.

3. ""The primary use of technology by young people is for entertainment,"" states media expert Michael Levine. On average, young people spend over seven hours in front of a screen every day. As a result, children and teenagers today spend as little as four minutes outside per day. Limiting the amount of time young people spend on their screens is one way to establish a healthy digital habit. By taking a break from digital devices, young people have more time to go outside. Collin O'Mara is the head of the National Wildlife Federation. She believes that outdoor free time provides a wide variety of benefits. Some of these benefits include better school performance, more creativity, and higher levels of fitness. Rather than spending several hours in front of a screen, people can gain the benefits from spending time outside instead.

4. Another boundary that people can set is avoiding using digital devices before going to sleep. Doctors suggest establishing a specific time of night when all devices must be turned off. Stopping the use of digital devices two hours before bedtime will likely lead to better sleep. Staring at a cell phone, computer, or television screen right before bedtime is distracting. Researcher Jean Twenge says that ""answering texts and scrolling through social media is mentally and emotionally stimulating, which leads to disturbed sleep."" In addition, the blue light that smartphones emit keeps the brain from producing melatonin. Melatonin helps people fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night. 

5. Being more mindful of when we use technology allows us to be more present when interacting with others. Doctors and scientists are concerned that the heavy use of electronic devices is creating a generation that is easily distracted. People who depend on technology shift their attention from one media platform to another about 27 times per hour. Additionally, the majority of young people say they would rather text people than speak with them in person. It can be difficult to have a meaningful conversation with friends when everyone is distracted by a cell-phone screen. If you notice that those around you are using their phones too much, speak up. It is much more rewarding to have a conversation with people who are _attentive_.

6. Some people think it is best to cut the use of technology completely. Although this seems like a good solution, eliminating technology is not always possible. The use of digital devices can even be helpful in some instances. For example, a student may want to use a computer to complete schoolwork. A person who is driving to an unfamiliar location may want to look up directions on a phone before making the trip. The goal is to use digital devices when they are needed but to spend some time away from them as well.

7. Forming healthier digital habits is possible without having to give up technology completely. Going on a digital diet may not be easy, but it is worth it.

2. It was a tradition my dad helped establish when we were little. One day Becca and I were having a huge argument over who got to play with Olivia the doll. A few minutes in time-out had not been enough for us to stop being angry at each other, so before bedtime our dad took us to the living room and turned on his favorite song.

3. ""You two are going to dance!"" he exclaimed with a huge smile. ""For a full five minutes. No talking, only rhythmic movement. Then you're going to bed.""

4. My sister and I shared the same expression as we stared back at my dad. _He had gone crazy._

5. Nonetheless, he replayed the song until we both agreed to start dancing. Becca went first—making a sarcastic, jerky movement—but it was all I needed to break out my best moves. Becca and I both started laughing and continued to dance as our anger crept out of the living room. After the five minutes were over, we were laughing so hard that neither of us remembered Olivia or why we had been angry.

6. Since that night, and up until recently, our five-minute dance party was something we returned to every evening; it was a refuge in the midst of our petty arguments and silly misunderstandings.

7. Now it was the night before Becca moved across the country to attend college, and it had been a whole month since our last dance party. We were older now, and I understood that Becca had things to do and was preoccupied with spending her final days of high school with her friends. I never realized how much I had cherished those nightly dance parties with my sister. I couldn't shake the feeling of how upset I would be if we didn't get to have one last dance party.

8. Becca and I sat with my parents at the dinner table as we had so many nights before. It was sad to think this would be the last time we all ate together for a while.

9. My mom had made Becca's favorite meal, but Becca seemed more distracted than usual. She quickly ate her meal and asked to be excused.

10. ""I just want to go say bye to Alex and Jeanie one more time!"" she exclaimed.

11. My mom sighed but agreed. I stared at the empty chair at the table and started to <u>reminisce<u> about times with Becca as I finished my meal. I thought about the days when our biggest problems involved Olivia the doll.

12. Some hours passed, and I began to get ready for bed, giving up on the notion that a last dance party would be happening. I felt childish worrying about it in the first place. Maybe it was time to grow up.

13. Suddenly I heard a slight knock on my door.

14. ""Are you still up?"" Becca whispered and tiptoed in.

15. ""Yes, I'm still awake. What are you doing?""

16. Becca chuckled and flicked on the light. ""Julie, you didn't seriously think I was going to leave tomorrow without us dancing it out one more time, did you?""

17. I tried to fight the smile from forming on my lips and threw a pillow at her.

18. ""I think it's only appropriate that I get to pick the departing song,"" she declared.

19. I stood waiting, assuming she'd pick a song by one of those weird groups she had been listening to lately. I was surprised when the melody of Dad's favorite song—the one that had started it all— began playing. Becca jerked her arm and started dancing, and I laughed, following her lead. We didn't even notice when Dad stepped into the doorway, watching us with the same smile he had on that first night.

20. I basked in the bittersweet, realizing that these were the moments to cherish. Things would always be changing, and though I hated to think of my sister leaving, the fact that this last dance was as important to her as it was to me made the moment even more  special. I pushed the thought of Becca leaving tomorrow out of my head, and we danced.""","*Read the next two selections and choose the best answer to each

Alix shouted and greeted Brittany with a hug after an excruciating practice. ""But tomorrow, it might help if you reduce the number of flips toward the end of the routine so that it can look a bit more polished—then you're sure to get a perfect score.""

2. ""Look, Alix,"" Brittany interrupted, unable to hide her feelings. ""I know what's best for my routine—I've been perfecting it for months—and I can figure out what needs to be fixed, if anything. I've got it from here.""

3. Alix frowned, clearly perturbed by Brittany's response.

4. ""I'm sorry, Brittany, I know you're great at gymnastics, but I was just trying to offer some advice. I just thought . . . never mind. I'll give you some space."" With that, Alix turned and headed toward the exit.

5. Brittany felt a dark cloud above her, realizing she had driven her friend away, but she refused to let her feelings distract her. _It'll be easier to focus without the constant critiquing,_ Brittany convinced herself.

6. Five days had passed since Brittany had confronted Alix—and just two days were left until the competition.

7. ""Come on, Brittany—watch that somersault!"" Coach Jen yelled from the sidelines as Brittany rehearsed her routine. Brittany grunted with pain and frustration; her muscles were strained, and sweat from her brow stung her eyes. Brittany looked into the stands and saw the empty seat beside Coach Jen and tried to ignore the pang she felt from her friend's absence.

8. Coach Jen approached Brittany after practice. ""You seem off your game, Brit—and you need to get it together by Saturday morning. I'd hate to see all your hard work go to waste."" Coach Jen walked off with a look of disappointment, leaving Brittany feeling alone.

9. Brittany sat on the tumbling mat, her hands holding her head as if it were a weighty boulder. Alix always nitpicked her performance too, but she always had something supportive to say as well. Brittany missed the encouragement Alix gave her when she was doubting herself—like now. Brittany stared at the empty stands, imagining how she must have made Alix feel.

10. When the day of the competition finally arrived, Brittany was plagued with nerves. Her parents were in the stands, and Coach Jen was in the front row beside other coaches. Brittany practiced her moves and, although she had memorized the routine, she felt clumsy and insecure. Brittany stood with a <u>solemn<u> expression, concerned that this was about to be a disaster.

11. ""You're going to be great!"" Brittany heard suddenly. She turned toward the familiar voice and was stunned to see Alix walking toward her.

12. Brittany stood with her mouth hanging open. ""I really didn't think you were going to show up. I'm sorry—you were just trying to help me, and I didn't want to take the time to listen to what you had to say.""

13. Alix enveloped Brittany in a hug. ""I know how important this competition is to you, Brit. There's no way I was going to miss this— you're my best friend! I know you needed your space, but that doesn't mean I was going to abandon you.""

14. Alix placed her hands on Brittany's shoulders and gave her a little shake. ""You've got this, Brit; and no matter what happens, I'll be cheering you on."" Brittany gave Alix a warm embrace before Alix went to sit in the stands beside Brittany's parents.

15. After a few moments, the judges announced the beginning of the event and called Brittany's name first. Brittany approached the edge of the mat with her head held high. She saw Alix, giving two thumbs up, and Brittany envisioned the judges giving her the same gesture after her routine.

2022-staar-may-grade-7-reading-releasedtest.pdf,6,"""1. Most people know that exercise is important. When people think of exercise, they probably envision someone muscular lifting hundreds of pounds on a barbell or swift and strong sprinters speeding along a racetrack. It is daunting to think about exerting this kind of energy. However, you don't have to be like the professional athletes who push their bodies to the limit to get in a good workout. Luckily there is a much easier form of exercise that is just as beneficial as an intense sport. If you are looking to incorporate exercise into your routine, then you should consider walking.

*Easing into Exercise*

2. The American Heart Association recommends that people get 150 minutes of exercise a week. That means that a person should exercise for about 30 minutes a day, five days a week. A half hour of brisk walking can easily help someone meet that goal. Simply increasing your normal walking speed from a slothlike pace to a quick-step movement counts as a moderate form of exercise. You don't need to walk 30 minutes all at one time to start either. A professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Dr. I-Min Lee, recommends that beginners start with three short 10-minute walks. Eventually longer walks will become easier. Who knew that such a small change in something we already do counts as exercise?

3. Some people believe that exercise requires certain equipment or gear. For this reason people are discouraged to exercise because they do not believe they have what they need. One great benefit to walking is that you do not need special equipment. You do not even need to have access to a special area like a racetrack. You can begin walking toward better health as early as today. Don't have workout clothes to wear? You're in luck, because what you're wearing right now is probably perfect for walking. Anywhere you can walk at a quick pace is a suitable way to get in your daily steps. Once you are finished, you can have the satisfaction of knowing you have done something good for your health. All you need to do is walk quickly enough to raise your heart rate.

*It Does a Body Good*

4. Many studies stress the values of walking and its benefits for our health and fitness. According to a Harvard Medical School study, research has shown that briskly walking for 30 minutes can burn over 100 calories. Walking also builds muscle in your legs and core. Although it may not seem like it, walking is weight training because your legs carry the weight of your upper body whenever you walk. Walking does not cause the same strain on your bones that running or other high-impact exercises do. As a result, walking helps your leg bones become stronger and resist the bone loss that typically happens as people get older.

5. Even your immune system benefits when you walk. A report from Harvard noted one study involving over 1,000 participants. It showed that ""those who walked at least 20 minutes a day, at least five days a week, had 43% fewer sick days than those who exercised once a week or less. And if they did get sick, it was for a shorter duration, and their symptoms were milder."" Beyond reducing your chances of catching the common cold, walking has been shown to reduce your risk of developing several severe diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease.

*Clear Your Mind*

6. If the physical perks of walking aren't enough to motivate you, know that walking also has positive effects on your mood. Walks can be taken in peaceful places such as nature trails or parks. Walking in these areas can help a person feel calm. Going on a daily walk gives your mind a break from the busyness of each day as well. A good walk lets you clear your mind. The exercise causes your brain to produce chemicals that improve your mood. As a bonus, walking with a friend provides a bonding opportunity to strengthen your relationships and enjoy the company of others.

*Join the Crowd*

7. Walking has long been valued as a way to stay fit. It has also been a way for people to engage in healthy competition. It is believed that hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt document walking contests dating over 4,000 years ago! A competitive sport known as racewalking officially began in England when the Amateur Athletics Association (AAA) held the AAA Championships in 1880. Since then racewalking has gone on to become an Olympic event.

8. Walking for exercise is increasing in popularity with the arrival of new technologies too. Fitness trackers and step counters on smartphones and wristbands are becoming commonplace. People can set goals on these trackers to help themselves reach the numbers of steps they hope to walk each day. It is clear that people everywhere are embracing this great activity.

9. If you are looking for a simple exercise that comes with several benefits, then walking may be the activity for you. Lace up your shoes, and take a walk! ""","*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2022-staar-may-grade-8-reading-releasedtest,1,"""1. Urban planners believe high-speed trains are the best way to improve urban transportation in the United States. Promoters of high-speed transportation in the United States say that high-speed-train travel provides several benefits that will revolutionize our transportation system. In 2018 Florida opened the Brightline Express. This intercity rail system is a success with passengers. But should all U.S. cities embrace high-speed trains? There are good reasons to answer ""yes"" to the high-speed-train revolution!

*Efficiency Equals Better Air Quality*

2. Many researchers say the U.S. transportation system is not very efficient or environmentally friendly. Commuters drive single-occupant cars hundreds of miles a day. This creates a lot of exhaust. A recent study showed that high-speed trains produce five times less carbon dioxide than cars. That's because high-speed trains mostly use electricity for power. By encouraging millions of people to use high-speed trains, air quality in a city could be improved.

3. High-speed railways are the world's ""greenest"" form of transportation. When Californians developed the vision for their high-speed rail system, they considered the environment. They decided they wanted ""a high-speed rail system that will deliver fast, direct travel between the state's major regions while providing environmental benefits."" California has some of the most congested urban areas in the nation. As a result, the state's air quality is poor. The California High-Speed Rail Authority believes these issues could be relieved with implementation of a high-speed rail system.

*Time, Stress, and Safety*

4. Using high-speed trains has other benefits too. High-speed trains move much faster than cars. In a car it can take up to five hours to drive round-trip from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Miami. This is similar to the round-trip distance between the Texas cities of San Antonio and Corpus Christi. A high-speed train takes only about 60 minutes each way. That is less than half the time it takes to get there by car! High-speed trains provide a method of reaching far distances in a short amount of time. Therefore, people who work far from where they live would be able to cut their travel time significantly. Travelers using a high-speed rail system can save valuable time in their day.

5. Traveling on busy roads can also be stressful. Have you ever been stuck in a car during a traffic jam at rush hour? Often, urban car travel means dealing with stopped traffic, major delays, and accidents. However, on a train you can read, nap, or watch the scenery whizzing by. There's no need to concentrate on the road ahead.

6. Not only is train travel faster and more relaxing, it is also safer. In fact, high-speed trains are considered to be one of the world's safest forms of transportation, according to international studies. Japan's high-speed trains have transported 10 billion passengers since they were introduced in 1964 without a single accident! France also has a record of safe train travel over the course of many years.

*Cheap and Convenient*

7. High-speed trains can help address the affordability of urban transportation. Trains save consumers the expense of owning a car. Cars come with many maintenance costs. People in urban settings typically have to pay for parking as well. A person using a high-speed train for daily travel could save thousands of dollars over time. That person would also avoid the hassle of finding and paying for a parking space in a crowded city. Additionally, those who are used to driving by car would be able to spend less money on gas if they took a high-speed train instead.

8. Even though high-speed trains would curtail car use, cars would still be needed. Some people will have to depend on a car to get them to and from the train station. Regardless, the amount of time saved by not driving to other destinations would still help people save money and put less wear on their cars.

*Local Economy Boosts*

9. According to urban planners, high-speed rail systems promise to add major real-estate development around its stations. This includes housing as well as stores and restaurants for the many local residents and commuters. The real-estate development will in turn support local manufacturing and construction jobs.

10. High-speed rail systems also provide a variety of jobs. The new technology involved in high-speed trains means more jobs in building components of the system. There is also the job of managing the trains and tracks. In addition, more jobs will be available for operating the stations as well as running new surrounding businesses.

*Embracing the Change*

11. Encouraging an entire nation to embrace ""train culture"" will definitely be a challenge. Many people prefer having their own method of transportation and the freedom it provides. Others are unfamiliar with trains, and they do not know how to plan a trip or read a train schedule. Navigating a train station can be chaotic. However, saving time, energy, and money may help convince people to give high-speed trains a chance.

12. Urban cities across the United States should consider a high-speed train system. High-speed-train travel offers many benefits that cars cannot provide. People everywhere should be ""all aboard"" for this efficient and safe mode of transportation.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2022-staar-may-grade-8-reading-releasedtest,2,"""1. He knew he was small.

2. He just didn't _think_ he was small.

3. _Big_ difference.

4. Danny had known his whole life how small he was compared to everybody in his grade, from the first grade on. How he had been put in the front row, front and center, of every class picture taken. Been in the front of every line marching into every school assembly, first one through the door. Sat in the front of every classroom. Hey, little man. Hey, little guy. He was used to it by now. They'd been studying DNA in science lately; being small was in his DNA. He'd show up for soccer, or Little League baseball tryouts, or basketball, when he'd first started going to basketball tryouts at the Y, and there'd always be one of those clipboard dads who didn't know him, or his mom. Or his dad.

5. Asking him: ""Are you sure you're with the right group, little guy?""

6. Meaning the right _age_ group.

7. It happened the first time when he was eight, back when he still had to put the ball up on his shoulder and give it a heave just to get it up to a ten-foot rim. When he'd already taught himself how to lean into the bigger kid guarding him, just because there was always a bigger kid guarding him, and then step back so he could get his dopey shot off.

8. This was way back before he'd even tried any fancy stuff, including the crossover.

9. He just told the clipboard dad that he was eight, that he was little, that this was his right group, and could he have his number, please? When he told his mom about it later, she just smiled and said, ""You know what you should hear when people start talking about your size? Blah blah blah.""

10. He smiled back at her and said that he was pretty sure he would be able to remember that.

11. ""How did you play?"" she said that day, when she couldn't wait any longer for him to tell.

12. ""I did okay.""

13. ""I have a feeling you did more than that,"" she said, hugging him to her. ""My streak of light.""

14. But here was the deal, when he added it all up: His height had always been much more of a stinking issue for other people, including his mom, than it was for him.

15. He tried not to sweat the small stuff, basically, the way grown-ups always told you.

16. He knew he was faster than everybody else at St. Patrick's School. And at Springs School, for that matter. Nobody on either side of town could get in front of him. He was the best passer his age, even better than Ty Ross, who was better at everything in sports than just about anybody. He knew that when it was just kids—which is the way kids always liked it in sports—and the parents were out of the gym or off the playground and you got to just play without a whistle blowing every ten seconds or somebody yelling out more instructions, he was always one of the first picked, because the other guys on his team, the shooters especially, knew he'd get them the ball.

17. Most kids, his dad told him one time, know something about basketball that even most grown-ups never figure out.

18. One good passer changes everything.

19. Danny could pass, which is why he'd always made the team.

20. Almost always.

21. But no matter what was happening with any team he'd ever played on, no matter how tired he would be after practice, no matter how much homework he still had left, this driveway was still his special place. Like a special club with a membership of one, the place where he could come out at this time of night and imagine it up good, imagine it big and bright, even with just the one floodlight over the backboard and the other light, smaller, over the back door. His mother had done everything she could to make the driveway wider back here, even cutting into what little backyard they had the summer before last. ""I told them you needed more room in the corners,"" she said. ""The men from the paving company. They just nodded at me, like corners were some sort of crucial thing.""

22. He had just enough room in the corners now, mostly for shooting. He didn't feel as if he was trying to make a drive to the basket in his closet. Or an elevator car. He had room to _maneuver,_ pretend he really was at the real Garden1, that he was one of the small fast guys who'd made it all the way there. Like Muggsy Bogues, somebody he'd read up on when one of his coaches told him to, who was only 5-3 and made it to the NBA. Like Tiny Archibald and Bobby Hurley and Earl Boykins, a 5-5 guy who came out of the basketball minor leagues, another streak of light who showed everybody that more than size mattered, even in hoops.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2. ""Oh no—we should do something!"" I exclaimed. I had adopted my collie, Boots, from the shelter, and I instantly wanted to help.

3. ""Maybe we could raise some money,"" I proposed as our bikes rolled to a stop.

4. Shelby groaned, eyeing me apprehensively. ""I wanted to spend my summer biking.""

5. ""Surely there's something we could do to support the shelter and still have time for biking . . . a bake sale, maybe? Or a fun run!"" Suddenly I had the perfect idea.

6. ""Wait! I've got it!"" I shouted. ""We could raise funds by biking around Lake Superior—it's the world's largest freshwater lake! We could ask people to pledge money for each mile we ride.""

7. ""We'd have to ride over a thousand miles to bike around the lake,"" Shelby interrupted, overwhelmed, but her eyes glimmered with anticipation too. ""Let's go ask our parents,"" she agreed.

8. A month later Shelby and I left from Duluth, Minnesota, on the first leg of our lengthy Lake Superior bicycle tour. Shelby's mom was going to be our support team on the road.

Yet, throughout the journey, we met many friendly people who cheered us on and kept us motivated.

We saw the Soo Locks, where freighters traveled from Lake Superior to Lake Huron; we heard the thundering Kakabeka Falls and stopped to visit the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. After ten days of biking, we whooped with amazement when we realized over 2,000 people had ""liked"" our posts on social media.

2022-staar-may-grade-8-reading-releasedtest,4,"""1. People have crossed the country by bicycle, motorcycle, and even on foot. However, one of the most astonishing treks of all time was accomplished on horseback in 1910. It's not the horses that made the trip so unique, though. It's that the horseback riders were two tough young boys from the South. They were only nine and six years old!

2. Bud and Temple Abernathy were born with adventure in their blood. Their father was U.S. Marshall Jack Abernathy. His speed and skills on horseback were phenomenal enough to catch the attention of President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Abernathy spent time together in Frederick, Oklahoma, in April of 1905. It was during this visit that Roosevelt saw firsthand the outstanding horsemanship of Jack Abernathy.

3. Jack Abernathy helped his sons plan the trip. They were to travel no more than 50 miles a day and to carry no more than five dollars with them at a time. They were allowed to cross creeks and rivers but only when the water was clear enough that they could see the bottom. They were not allowed to travel at all on Sundays.

4. Bud's horse was named Sam Bass, and Temple rode a pony named Geronimo. Even with a pony, six-year-old Temple was so small that he had to mount his horse using a tree stump or stool. The boys took off on their 2,000-mile trip departing from Frederick, Oklahoma. They traveled with some extra clothes, oats for their horses, and food for themselves. They were headed to New York City, where they would join a parade to welcome Theodore Roosevelt home from his international travels.

5. The boys faced snowstorms, treacherous river crossings, snakes, and scorpions on their journey. They crossed American Indian Territory, even stopping to rest at some Indian camps. As news of their feat spread across the countryside, families would welcome them into their homes for a home-cooked meal and a welcome bit of <u>repose<u>

6. As Bud and Temple continued east, newspaper reporters would congregate to meet them. The press was eager to write about their adventure, and Americans were eager to read about it. After about two months the boys arrived in New York City. There they joined one million people in the welcoming parade, riding proudly down Fifth Avenue alongside the Rough Riders, Roosevelt's group of 1,000 volunteer soldiers, and their proud father.""",,*The Ride of a Lifetime!*,,,,,,,,,,Bud and Temple Abernathywith Their Father; The Abernathy Brothers Heading East,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2022-staar-may-grade-8-reading-releasedtest,5,"""1. Ever have a food that you tasted and you immediately disliked? Maybe it was broccoli, dark chocolate, or cottage cheese. Maybe you were ""encouraged"" to try the food again (and again!), and then one of those times you actually liked it. Many people have had this experience. While tastes are developed at a young age, they can be altered. All it takes is a person's desire to try something new or unknown.

2. In 2014, researchers at the University of Birmingham released a study that showed people have a flavor window. The flavor window is open when an infant is four to six months old. During this time it is easier to get babies to try a food they have not previously tasted. The flavor window slowly closes, leaving most young children <u>dubious<u> of new foods.

3. A later study, which was published in the _British Journal of Nutrition,_ also found that a willingness to try new foods can be learned by infants. The researchers determined that habitually giving a baby new foods when the flavor window is open makes the child more likely to enjoy those foods. In addition, liking those foods makes the infant more willing to try other new foods. This information suggests that parents should introduce new foods to babies during this stage. By doing so they will tend to appreciate new types of foods throughout their lives.

4. Just because the flavor window closes at a young age doesn't mean it can't be reopened. The keys to expanding the type of foods one enjoys are persistence and exposure. A study published in Food Quality and Preference found that if toddlers are introduced to a new food five to 10 times, they can grow to like it. That amount goes up as children grow older. Ultimately, the study came to the conclusion that the flavor window may never be completely shut.

5. We learn to like or dislike flavors in three main ways. The first is called flavor-nutrient learning. A person can form a positive association with a flavor of a particular food and what it does for his or her body. For example, a child eats chocolate-chip cookies, and the sugar provides a burst of energy. The taste, combined with the results, leads the child to enjoy the cookie and foods with similar flavors.

6. The second way is called taste-flavor learning. This is when a person connects a particular flavor with one they already enjoy. For example, if you like peanut butter, spread it on a new type of bread you are tasting for the first time. It might make all the difference in your opinion of the bread.

7. Last, there's social learning, meaning that people enjoy what their families and friends enjoy. This is a lifelong learning process (it actually starts before birth!). If, for example, a mother drinks carrot juice while pregnant, the baby will probably enjoy carrot-flavored cereal more than babies whose mothers did not drink carrot juice. As children grow, this third type of learning takes place while talking about food in social situations and tasting new foods with friends and family.

8. People's tastes evolve over time in similar ways. For example, adults tend to enjoy sweets less than when they were children. They typically enjoy vegetables more. The reasons for these are biological. A child's love of sugar could be related to the need to give fuel to a growing body. Adults' greater appreciation for vegetables, despite bitter tastes and people's natural aversion to bitterness, comes from persistence. Children copy what they see adults eating and often learn to like vegetables.

9. Being willing to try a new food repeatedly is necessary to pry a person's flavor window open again. Each attempt will lessen the natural suspicion of something new. Eventually, ""not bad"" can turn into ""pretty good."" One method for inspiring courage to try new foods multiple times is testing different preparations. Adding an ingredient—sugar or salt, perhaps—that one enjoys, might make an unappealing food more appealing. Once the person has trained him or herself to like the food, the added ingredient may not be necessary.

10. Overcoming a dislike of a particular food requires tasting a food in different ways and at different times. In spite of strange smells, odd textures, or distinctive flavors, a person has the ability to acquire a true liking for even the most unique and unusual foods. So don't give up—you never know when you might surprise yourself and discover that broccoli is your new favorite food!""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2022-staar-may-grade-8-reading-releasedtest,6,"""1. Maybe I ought to just live in my tree—when I am up here, I can just be myself, by myself. Here, I don't have to contend with Mom saying, ""Cheer up, Millie. I'm sure you'll make new friends. You just have to try a little harder.""

2. If they are really so concerned about me, then they would get me out of volleyball and out of tutoring Stanford Wong.

3. Despite my compelling arguments, my mother does not agree with the fresh new direction I suggested my summer activities take. In fact, she even threatened that if I did not stop complaining (""whining"" was the term she used), she would also enroll me in synchronized swimming. Thus, it was with great reluctance that I showed up for volleyball again. Luckily, I was already on a team and did not have to suffer the indignity of being chosen last—there's enough of that at school.

4. The game began auspiciously enough with the ball flying back and forth, unless, of course, it came anywhere in my vicinity. When it was my turn to serve, I somehow managed to make the ball go behind me. This produced a great deal of tittering from both sides of the net. Embarrassed, I moved forward and prayed that the gym would catch fire or that the ball would explode.

5. A rather tall, scary girl from the other team took her place to serve. She looked like she could squish me like a bug. Grinning, the girl tossed the ball up in the air with ease. Then she smashed it in the desired direction.

6. I squeezed my eyes shut as the ball came barreling down at me in what seemed like slow motion.

7. Suddenly, _BANG_! Contact. To everyone's amazement, I sent the ball flying back to enemy territory. It landed at the feet of the server and then bounced away.

8. There was a stunned silence as jaws dropped in unison.

9. Then, at once, laughter erupted. It echoed in the gym and I am sure could be heard throughout Rancho Rosetta.

10. ""She kicked the ball!"" someone howled.

11. I could have just died.

12. Somehow I managed to struggle through the rest of the game. Not making eye contact with anyone helped, although I am sure my teammates were miffed that I kept bumping into them.

13. When at last the game was over, I plopped down against the bleachers, rummaged through my briefcase, and fished out a bag of Cheetos and a Gatorade. After I tried in vain to twist the cap off my drink, the girl sitting next to me took the bottle from me and
opened it on the first try. Of course, I'm sure I had loosened it quite a bit.

14. I studied the bottle opener and recognized her as one of the few who did not laugh at me.

15. ""Hi,"" the girl said.

16. ""How do you do?"" I answered with some trepidation.

17. ""I'm Emily and I just moved here. Don't you hate volleyball? Isn't Coach Gowin just awful? Wouldn't you just love to get your hands on whoever gave her that whistle?""

18. She paused for a breath, and I seized the chance to get a word in. ""I'm Millicent L. Min. Yes. Yes. Ha! Yes,"" I replied, as I wiped my palm in anticipation of a more formal introduction and a handshake.

19. You can tell a lot about a person by the way they shake hands. Some people try to crush your bones to prove that they're in control; others barely move their hands and make you do all the work. Then there's the firm, friendly ""hello-there-sincerely-glad- to-meet-you"" handshake that I strive to achieve. My mother and I practiced for weeks until I got it right.

20. The girl tossed formalities aside and continued chatting. I smiled and waited patiently to find out why she thought we were friends. To my delight, I was surprisingly at ease with Emily. We found ourselves finishing each other's sentences. It was so liberating to talk with someone my own age without the topic of my being a genius coming up and getting in the way.

21. ""My mom thinks volleyball will be good for me . . . you know, get coordinated and meet new people, blah, blah, blah,"" she confided as she let down her ponytail and shook it out.

22. ""So tell me, why are you here? No offense, but you didn't look like you enjoyed yourself at all—in fact, a couple of times I thought you were going to cry.""

23. I could have explained that because I went through school at an accelerated rate, I was never expected to fully participate in physical education. Yet if Emily knew I was a genius she might weird out on me like the rest of them. In a nanosecond I had to decide whether to tell the truth and risk losing a potential friend, or lie and live with the consequences.""","*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2019staargr3readingtest2,2,"""1. Have you ever read a Little Golden Book? Chances are good that you have. They are some of the most famous children's books in the United States. Little Golden Books can be found in many stores and libraries. They have made reading easier and more enjoyable for millions of young readers.

*A Great Start*

2. At one time children's books cost too much for many families. Most books for children were made out of fancy paper. Almost all books for children were fairy tales or nursery rhymes. However, in 1942 a group of people who print books, called publishers, had a great idea. What if they could print children's books that cost less money? Instead of selling the books in expensive bookstores, the books could be sold at department stores. The books could be fairy tales, or about regular people or other interesting topics. The books would be so enjoyable that children would be encouraged to love reading.

*Little Books for All*

3. It did not take long for Little Golden Books to become a big hit. In the first year, more than
1.5 million books were sold. Until then, many children's books cost $1.50. That was a lot of money so long ago. But Little Golden Books cost only 25 cents. More people could afford the books.

4. Soon Little Golden Books could be found in grocery stores. The books were easy for buyers to find because they had their own unique look. They all had golden foil on the spine of the book.

*Stories to Read and Enjoy*

5. At first only twelve different titles of Little Golden Books were printed. One of these twelve was called _The Poky Little Puppy._ It is still in print today. More than 15 million copies of this title have been sold, which is more copies than any other children's picture book. Used by permission of Penguin Random House LLC. All rights reserved.

6. Soon more titles were added. The book _Two Little Miners_ taught children about a job. The book _Here Comes the Parade_ told all about the big Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade that happens every year in New York City. _Doctor Dan The Bandage Man_ gave readers some tips for how to stay safe and healthy. The book also came with a sample of bandages. The Poky Little Puppy written by Janette Sebring Lowery, illustrated by Gustaf Terggren; and Doctor Dan The Bandage Man written by Jacqueline Woodson, illustrated by Corinne Malvern. Used by permission of Penguin Random House LLC. All rights reserved.

2. The man looked up from the rows of numbers, but he didn't speak.

3. ""I want to learn to fly,"" Bessie said.

4. ""Are you from England or America?"" the man asked.

5. ""America,"" she said.

6. ""You've come all this way for lessons?""

7. ""Yes,"" Bessie said.

8. ""Very good. Tomorrow at nine o'clock. Is that a good time?""

9. Bessie thought she could never be happier. But she was, the next day, in the sky.

10. There she watched her instructor carefully. She copied what he did to move the plane up or down.

11. Finally, it was time to solo.^1 As she sat in the open cockpit, she was afraid, but she let fear be a companion. The wind whistled over her head and carried away the sound of her laughter.

12. Courage was like a muscle that got stronger as she used it. Bessie enjoyed perfecting her skills while traveling around Europe. After a year of flying, she returned home with a license. She could fly anywhere on Earth. But could she make a living as a pilot?

13. Once Bessie's ship had docked, late in the summer of 1922, Robert Abbott^2 called some friends, who arranged for her to appear at a parade honoring veterans. People cheered as the soldiers marched to a field. And a band raised trombones and beat drums while Bessie Coleman strode toward a plane. She wore a belt around her slender waist, with a strap crossing her chest. Her dark eyes shone beneath the goggles she'd pushed to the top of her head.

14. When she stepped into the cockpit, the band played ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Bessie flew over and around the field, climbing, diving, turning the plane in circles, then in figure eights. She made loops, as if she were dragging invisible banners through the sky. She never wanted to come down.

15. The next day, newspapers raved about the show. Word of Bessie's nerve and skill spread. Soon she was invited to perform at fields, then at bigger airstrips, in towns and later in cities. Tickets sold quickly.

16. Bessie earned enough money to buy her own plane. She crossed the country to California, then flew back to Chicago and finally to Waxahachie, Texas, the town where she'd grown up.
2Robert Abbott was a newspaper publisher who supported Bessie's interest in being a pilot.

17. There a crowd gathered to watch her pilot her airplane toward the clouds. She stopped the plane in midair, turned it around, and sped toward the ground. Spectators ducked as she came close enough to blow off their hats. Then Bessie steered the plane back up.

18. A few minutes later, Bessie landed smoothly. She took off her helmet, goggles, and gloves. People cheered.

19. Girls and boys asked for autographs. ""You can do this, too,"" Bessie told them, and a new dream rose within her. She wanted to open the sky to others, to make a place where people heard ""Try"" and ""Go on,"" instead of ""Stop"" or ""Turn back."" Bessie Coleman wanted to make the earth feel as free and splendid as the sky. She vowed to save her money to start a school for pilots.

20. ""Do it again,"" a girl begged.

2019staargr3readingtest2,4,"""1. Ask anyone who has been to the Texas State Fair in Dallas, Texas, to tell you what it's like. You might hear stories of the exciting rides, tasty food, and interesting farm animals. One thing you will definitely hear about is Big Tex. He is the giant cowboy who greets people at the front gate. His huge arm waves at visitors as he welcomes them with a cheerful ""Howdy!""

*Big Tex in the Beginning*

2. Since 1952, children and grown-ups have enjoyed seeing Big Tex. In 1951, the state fair president bought Big Tex. He thought it would be nice to have a big cowboy as a symbol of Texas at the fair. So Big Tex was placed at the entrance.

3. The giant cowboy was made out of metal, paper, cardboard, and glue. He stood 52 feet tall. He wore colorful clothing, a huge cowboy hat, and a giant pair of cowboy boots. Thick wires attached to Big Tex's body kept him from falling over. His hand was positioned to look like he was waving to visitors. 

*Big Tex stood tall and smiled.*

4. By 1953, Big Tex could speak. Words that had been <u>prerecorded<u> played over speakers while the giant cowboy's mouth moved. As the words played, his mouth moved like a puppet—open, closed, open, closed. 

5. In 1997, Big Tex got a new look. His body was rebuilt with stronger materials. And by 2000, his arm could move. Big Tex waved at visitors as they entered the state fair.

*Big Tex Gets Bigger*

6. Unfortunately, in 2012 there was an accident, and Big Tex was destroyed in a fire. Although people were disappointed, a man named R. Eddy Snell realized this was a chance to make a bigger and better Big Tex. Snell's company had built a large dragon and giant cowboy boots before. Yet he knew the big cowboy would not be an easy job.

7. Snell had big ideas for the new cowboy. The new Big Tex would be taller. He would stand firmly on the ground without wires attached to hold him up. The new Big Tex's face would move and look more like a real cowboy. He would also have fingers that move and point. Overall, the new Big Tex would be more lifelike.

8. Snell's company wanted the new Big Tex to surprise people at the fair, so the company worked secretly for ten months. The workers were not allowed to tell anyone what they were building. In fact, they used a secret code for Big Tex in emails and on the phone. They called him ""fried chicken."" Drawings of the designs were also labeled ""fried chicken."" This way, the workers could keep the big cowboy a secret until he was finished.

9. Snell's workers found a new way to make Big Tex's face. A soft, light material called Styrofoam was used. It could be <u>carved<u> easily into the shape of a face. Then, thin layers of other soft materials were placed on top. This way, the mouth could move almost like a person's mouth. The workers were careful to use materials that would not burn easily. It was important to avoid another fire.

10. At last, Big Tex was finished. His steel-frame body was taken to a clothing factory. There, hundreds of yards of fabric were used to make his clothes. Big Tex was dressed in a red, white, and blue shirt, denim jeans, colorful cowboy boots, and an even bigger cowboy hat.

11. It was time to take Big Tex to his place at the fairgrounds. A large crane and several workers set him in place. He stood behind white curtains, and on September 26, 2013, the curtains were dropped. At last, everyone could see the new Big Tex.

12. Now, every fall, Big Tex greets visitors to the state fair with a smile, a nod, and a wink. He points the way to fun attractions.

13. Snell is happy with the work his team did to build Big Tex. ""I know we won't please everybody,"" Snell says, ""but I think future generations will love this Tex.""

2. When the bus stopped and his friends Rashid and Timothy climbed aboard, Christopher stood up and waved eagerly.

3. ""Christopher Ledbetter,"" the bus driver scolded. ""No standing on my bus!"" Christopher slumped into his seat as his friends sat next to him.

4. The fourth-grade picnic was scheduled for tomorrow, and Christopher's mother had said that he could go under one condition—that he didn't get into any more trouble this week.

5. ""What a terrible week!"" Christopher grumbled. ""First braces, and now I might not be able to go to the picnic.""

6. ""But today is Friday, Christopher,"" Timothy reminded him. ""You only have to stay out of trouble one more day.""

7. The bus chugged up a hill. To Christopher the turning wheels seemed to be groaning, ""One more day! One more day!""

8. ""All right!"" he burst out.

9. ""Christopher!"" called the bus driver. ""Quiet down back there!""

10. Christopher hadn't meant to yell. He never intended to get into
trouble, but it just seemed to happen.

11. Christopher explained to his friends that the week's misfortunes were not his fault. On Tuesday he had scribbled a math problem on his desk, but only because he was out of paper. On Wednesday he had dropped grape jelly on his library book, causing the pages to stick together. He had told the librarian that he was just trying to catch up on his reading during lunch, but she still said that he would have to pay to replace the book. Yesterday he had tripped on his untied shoelaces and crashed into Maria Morris. He stood up now to demonstrate to Rashid and Timothy how it had happened.

12. ""Christopher!"" the bus driver called again. ""No standing on my bus!""

13. ""I'm going to miss the picnic,"" Christopher sighed.

14. Rashid and Timothy tried to make their friend feel more hopeful.

15. ""When my mother wants my sister and me to sit still, she tells us
to take deep breaths,"" Rashid said. ""You could try that.""

16. ""Well, I can breathe,"" Christopher said. He tried to open his mouth wide, but the rubber bands stretched between his top and bottom teeth were so tight that he could open his mouth only a little.

17. The bus came to a stop in front of the elementary school.

18. Christopher stepped off the bus and walked carefully, watching
his feet so that he wouldn't trip again. He was still looking down when he entered his classroom—and stumbled right into Maria Morris.

19. ""Take a deep breath,"" Christopher reminded himself. He opened his mouth as wide as he could when BOING! One of the rubber bands flew off his braces and landed on Maria.

20. Christopher clapped one hand over his mouth. He wanted to apologize, but he was afraid to open his mouth. Who knew what might pop out? And just as he feared, Maria complained to their teacher Mr. Gregg about the rubber band, and Christopher was sent to the principal's office.

21. Christopher shuffled slowly down the hall, trying not to think about his mother's warning and the class picnic he was sure to miss. Mrs. Vander, the principal, was standing at her office window. Christopher just knew that Mrs. Vander would never believe that he had accidentally shot the rubber band.

22. ""I was hoping I wouldn't see you today, Christopher,"" Mrs. Vander said, turning just in time to see him stumble over the rug in front of her desk. ""I haven't seen you since Wednesday.""

23. ""That's only because you weren't here yesterday,"" Christopher said truthfully. ""But really, Mrs. Vander, what happened just now wasn't my fault. I accidentally—"" he pleaded.

24. He heard the other rubber band snap off from his teeth and watched it sail through the air and land on Mrs. Vander's desk.

25. Then Mrs. Vander chuckled, exposing a mouth full of metal-covered teeth.

26 Christopher stared. ""That's where you were yesterday!"" he exclaimed. ""Now you have braces, too!""

27. ""Just like yours,"" Mrs. Vander said. ""And I'm having a little trouble with the rubber bands also.""

28. Mrs. Vander agreed to help Christopher explain the situation to Maria and Mr. Gregg, insisting he ""be on your best behavior for the rest of the day.""

29. ""Yes! Definitely!"" said Christopher. ""And besides...""

30. ""Yes?"" asked Mrs. Vander and flashed a silvery smile.

2019staargr4readingtest1,2,"""1. To many people, it may seem like a typical summer morning on the beach. There are sounds of seagulls calling and waves crashing against the sand. But there is also an unusual sound—the clicking of marbles as they slam against each other. A small crowd watches a group of young marble players, or ""mibsters,"" play a game of marbles. But marbles are not just for kids. Anyone can play with marbles.

*Marbles through Time*

2. People have been playing with marbles for thousands of years. No one really knows where and exactly when they were invented. Long ago, people played games that are similar to marble games played today. To make marbles, people used items that could roll such as nuts, fruit pits, or round pebbles. As time passed, people started creating marbles from other materials, like glass, steel, clay, and other stones. Different types of marbles have been found in places all around the world.

3. Clay marbles were once extremely popular, even though they weren't always perfectly round or particularly colorful. The main reason for their popularity was their low price. It cost much less to make clay marbles than it did to make glass marbles.

4. Glass marbles were originally handmade by skilled glassmakers. They were beautiful, and each one was unique. Some were made of a single bright color that you could see through. Others had swirls of one color or many different colors. Some marbles were even made of colored glass with silver flakes.

5. In the 1800s a German glassmaker came up with an easier way to make glass marbles. He invented special scissors that could cut melted glass. This made it easier and faster to make glass marbles in large quantities. Now, more people could buy them. Suddenly, glass marbles became very popular around the world.

6. Roughly one hundred years later, a man from Ohio designed a marble-making machine that used rollers to shape a small lump of melted glass into a perfect sphere. This machine method lowered the price of marbles even more.

*Marble Games*

7. Marble-making methods have continued to improve over the last 100 years. One thing that has not changed is the popularity of marbles. People around the world still enjoy marble games today.

8. Marble games can be just as different as the parts of the world where they are played. In China, players kick marbles, trying to bump the other players' marbles in a certain direction. In the United States, kids use their hands instead of their feet. In one game, the players tap the other players' marbles into a hole. In another game, the players must make their marbles roll under numbered arches.

9. One common marble game is called ""Ringers."" Marbles are placed inside a circle that is drawn on the ground. Players roll, drop, throw, or knuckle their ""shooter,"" trying to force the opponents' marbles out of the playing area. A shooter is usually bigger than the other marbles. The winner is the person who bumps the most marbles out of the circle.

10. Some people play for ""keepsies."" At the end of the game, the winner keeps the marbles he or she has knocked out of the ring. These games are always suspenseful. Players may lose some of their favorite marbles. But they could also win some marbles they like better than the ones they already have. Fortunately, the players can always agree to play ""friendlies"" before the game begins. That means that they will return each other's marbles at the end of the game.

11. Most people enjoy playing marbles just for the fun of it. On the other hand, some marble players take the game very seriously. Some of these experienced and determined players may be good enough to compete in the annual National Marbles Tournament in Wildwood, New Jersey. This competition was first held in 1922. Each year, thousands of competitors attend. Over the course of the four-day event, over 1,000 marble games are played. Winners receive prizes and awards, including college scholarships and national honors.

12. Throughout the world, children and adults enjoy marbles. There are many ways to play with marbles. But regardless of how they are used, marbles are fun and exciting for anyone who gives them a try.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

It felt like he had been digging for hours, but he still had a long way to go. Yesterday Grandpa had called Max's family to say he had bought a young apple tree that he wanted to plant in his yard. Max's father had volunteered Max to dig the deep, wide hole.

2. ""There are plenty of trees in Grandpa's yard already,"" Max thought bleakly. ""Why does he need another one?""

3. As Max sank the shovel deep into the earth, he heard it clink against something. ""Another rock,"" he thought. A bit more digging, however, revealed that the object was a large metal coffee can.

4. Max pried the can out of the soil with difficulty. He felt a shiver of excitement. ""Why is there a coffee can in Grandpa's yard?"" Max pulled off the plastic lid. A slip of paper sat at the top of the can. Max unfolded it and read, ""This is the time capsule of Leroy Scuro, age 10.""

5. Leroy Scuro was Max's father. Still somewhat mystified, Max hurried into the house with the can. ""Hey, look what I found!""

6. His father and grandfather examined the can. ""My goodness!"" Dad exclaimed. ""You found my time capsule. I had forgotten all about it."" Seeing Max's blank look, he explained, ""I wanted someone in the future to find the things I buried. Let's see how everything looks now.""

7. The first things Max pulled out of the can were some coins and bills. Most he recognized, but one quarter-size coin had a woman's face on it.

8. ""That's a Susan B. Anthony dollar,"" his father explained. ""They stopped making them many years ago.""

9. Next Max pulled out a key chain with a colorful, puzzle-like cube attached.

10. ""A Rubik's Cube. It was a popular toy in the 1980s,"" Dad said. The can also contained some shells, a small toy rocket, a cassette tape labeled ""Great Songs of the 1980s,"" and several photos.

11. ""Wow!"" Dad said as he picked up one of the old photographs. ""Look at that crazy hairstyle.""

12. ""I never knew you looked like that, Dad. It's really awesome to see pictures of you and some of the things you enjoyed when you were my age,"" Max said. ""I wonder if people in the future will think I'm as interesting.""

2019staargr4readingtest1,4,"""1. Imagine you are walking along the beach. Suddenly you see something shiny in the sand. Your inquiring mind makes you move in for a closer look. It is a glass bottle, and inside is a rolled-up piece of paper. This message in a bottle may have traveled halfway around the world before landing on this beach.

2. Strange as it may seem, people really do write notes, put them in bottles, and hurl the bottles into the ocean. They do so for different reasons. Most often it is simply for fun. All the world's oceans are connected, and tides can carry the bottles in many different directions. There is no telling where a bottle may end up or how far it may drift. For example, an elementary school student near Seattle, Washington, released a bottle that traveled more than 1,700 miles before being found in Alaska 21 years later. Similarly, a man tossed a bottle into the ocean near his New Hampshire motel. His note told the finder to return the bottle to his wife Tina for a reward. More than 50 years later, the bottle was found washed up on a Caribbean island nearly 2,000 miles away.

3. In 2007, students at a school in Hawaii participated in a science experiment called Message in a Bottle. As part of the experiment, about 25 bottles were released into the ocean to drift. Each bottle contained a message from a student, and the top was sealed with wax. Six months later a 13-year-old girl in Papua New Guinea found one. She and the <u>sender<u> became pen pals. Over time people found other bottles the students had released.

4. Occasionally someone tries to use a message in a bottle to contact a particular person. In 1914 a British soldier fighting in World War I wrote a letter to his wife. Eighty-five years after the soldier tossed his bottle into the sea, a fisherman found it in his fishing net. The fisherman delivered the letter to the soldier's daughter, who was an adult by then. She was thrilled to receive the letter and learn more about her father.

5. Tossing a bottle in the ocean is not a very reliable way to deliver a message. However, when a message _is_ found, it is certainly a memorable event.""",,*Messages in Bottles*,,,,,,,,,,What would you do if you found a message in a bottle?; A boy throws a message in a bottle into the vast sea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of half-scraped pans and dripping bowls And spoons she lets you lick.And then there are the stories That she tells you every night

And Mommy's doused the light—Stories of your relatives From other times and places, Having curious-sounding names

And always there is music Whenever Grandma comes—The lilting songs she loves to sing, The waltzes that she hums.

2019staargr4readingtest1,6,"""1. The crisp days of autumn are here. Something happens just before the brightly colored leaves begin to fall. _Plink! Plunk!_ The acorns are dropping! They're everywhere—they batter the roof of your house, the hood of your family's car, and even the top of your head. If you walk near an oak tree, you may feel as though you are skating on acorns. How about having an acorn for an afternoon snack? Unless you're a squirrel, that sounds nuts, doesn't it?

2. Believe it or not, people once joined the squirrels in gathering acorns to eat. Acorns were actually one of our earliest foods. They date back to prehistoric times when people had not yet learned to grow crops.

3. The ancient Romans made bread from ground acorns. In North America, acorns were a very important food for many Native American tribes into the early 1900s. Even the Pilgrims ate them! They discovered baskets of roasted acorns buried in the ground by Native Americans. Acorns helped the Pilgrims in their fight for survival during their first winter of 1620-21 in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

4. As these acorn pioneers would surely tell you, acorns are not for eating raw. If you bit into the next one you found, you would probably say, ""Ewww!"" Most raw acorns are bitter, and some kinds are poisonous to humans. The bitterness comes from tannins—chemicals that help protect acorns from insects. Luckily,tannins can be dissolved in water. In the past, people secured acorns in baskets and placed them in a stream, where rushing water washed away the tannins. Native Americans sweetened very bitter acorns by burying them in the mud of a swamp.

5. Some Native Americans even used acorns for medicine. Acorns were thought to soothe the throat, so a sick person might suck on a single tanbark acorn like a cough drop. Various California tribes also used acorn meal to treat skin infections. They allowed the acorns to grow mold, which they then scraped off and placed on bandages.

6. Animals have some unique uses for acorns, too. The acorn woodpecker, found in northwestern Oregon, California, the American Southwest, and western Mexico, uses its beak to chisel thousands of holes into a standing dead tree or telephone pole. An acorn is carefully hammered into each hole. When the woodpecker has finished working, its acorn storage tower looks like a miniature skyscraper covered with little windows.

7. Imagine being tiny enough to make an acorn your home! Small insects called acorn weevils are
usually the first to move in. The female acorn weevil uses her long snout to drill a hole and then lays several eggs within the acorn. The larvae eat the nut meat inside. When the acorn falls from the oak tree and hits the ground, this signals to the larvae that it's time to chew their way out.""

8. The hollowed-out acorn can now provide a home for other small creatures. A female acorn moth may lay eggs near the entrance to an acorn hole. After hatching, a caterpillar crawls right inside. It now has a cozy winter cabin. Snails, fungus gnats, or ants may be next in line to move into this tiny shelter.

9. It won't be long before acorns start hitting the ground. This fall, pay special attention to every _plink!_ and _plunk!_ You won't be using these extraordinary nuts for food, medicine, or a place to stay, but there are still plenty of reasons to be nuts about acorns.",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

That night after dinner while I cleared off the table and Mom put things in the dishwasher, I asked her, ""Did you and Dad talk about moving Kirk out of my room?""

2. ""Well, we talked about moving you into the office.""

3. ""Me? Why do I have to be the one to move?""

4. ""Because you're the one who wants his own room.""

5. ""But Kirk's the one that's impossible to live with.""

6. Mom handed me a dishcloth. ""Kirk's been in that room since he was a baby. It will be easier on him to be alone if he's still in familiar surroundings.""

7. ""But all the stuff in that room is mine. It's decorated with posters of my favorite baseball players.""

8. ""I know it's not exactly fair,"" Mom said, ""but if you want your own room, you'll have to make some <u>concessions<u>.""

9. I knew she meant I had to let Kirk have his own way.

10. ""But don't you think Kirk would like to decorate a room with something he likes?"" I asked. ""Something with cowboys or astronauts or trains?""

11. Mom poured the dish soap into its tray. ""Kirk does like trains,"" she said. As she wiped off the counters, she called, ""Kirk!"" A few moments later he trotted in.

12. Mom put on the overly happy face she always uses to try to get Kirk excited about something. ""Hey, sweetheart, I was just thinking about how much you like trains. Maybe you'd like to spend more time with some trains.""

13. ""Are we going someplace?"" Kirk asked hopefully.

14. ""Well, no. I was just thinking maybe we could decorate the office with train things. Would you like that?""

15. ""Yeah,"" Kirk said slowly, as though he knew there was a catch but wasn't sure where.

16. ""Wouldn't it be fun to move your bed in with all of the train things?""

17. ""No!"" His face scrunched up, and he put his hands on his hips. ""I'm not moving to the office. I want to sleep in my baseball room."" He stomped off.

18. She sighed. ""We'll give him a little time to adjust to the idea.""

19. I figured he could adjust while I moved his things out, but I didn't say so. I was being a model child.

20. On Sunday I told Kirk over and over again how neat his new room would be. It didn't matter. Kirk refused to adjust. He wanted his closet, _his_ window, and _his_ posters, which unfortunately also happened to be _my_ closet, _my_ window, and _my_ posters.

21. Mom and Dad said they'd try to reason with Kirk about it. Since when has reason solved anything in the world?

22. That night I tried my own methods to convince Kirk to move.

23. ""Kirk,"" I said, ""I haven't told you this before, but there's buried treasure somewhere in the office.""

24. Kirk surveyed me skeptically. ""What kind of treasure?""

25. ""Gold and silver,"" I whispered in awed tones, but when he didn't look impressed, I added, ""And Hot Wheels, and flashlights, and swords. If you move into the office, I bet you'll be able to find it.""

26. ""How come Mom and Dad have never told me about the treasure?""

2019staargr5readingtest2,2,"""1. There's something about the sight of furry koala bears—they look so cuddly, you just want to give them a hug. Of course, koalas don't hug . . . or do they? Recently, during an extreme heat wave in Australia, scientists noticed something unusual. As the temperatures rose, koalas high in the eucalyptus trees climbed down from the treetops. Then they spread out on lower tree limbs. It looked as if they were embracing the trunks. But why would koalas hug trees?

2. Scientists have studied koalas for years. They know that koalas cannot sweat. The tree-dwelling mammals have few ways to stay cool during the hottest days. They can lick themselves or pant. However, both methods cause them to dehydrate. They could leave the safety of their trees to search for water, but water is difficult to locate. Besides, the koalas might run into a predator.

3. The scientists decided to do some detective work. They tracked 37 koalas that had been radio tagged. The tags helped the scientists locate the koalas so they could observe the koalas more closely. First they noted the animals' posture and location in the trees. When the weather was mild, the koalas sat high up in the treetops. They ate eucalyptus leaves or curled up in balls. However, as the weather turned steamy, the koalas climbed farther down. They pressed their bodies close to tree trunks.

4. Next, scientists used technology to find out why the koalas behaved differently depending on the weather. They placed a special infrared camera on a long pole. The camera measured the air temperatures surrounding the animals wherever they chose to sit. Then scientists took photos. The camera made thermal images that showed heat. In thermal images, darker colors show cooler temperatures. Lighter colors represent hotter temperatures.

5. These images <u>verified<u> that koalas hug trees to keep cool. They showed that the tree trunks and lower limbs were up to nine degrees cooler than the surrounding air. The trees kept cool by drawing up water through their roots from deep below ground.

6. Koalas were using the trees to absorb their body heat. By completely spreading out against the cooler trees, the animals could lower their temperatures as much as 68 percent. This allowed the koalas to conserve the water in their bodies. No wonder these cuddly creatures wanted to wrap their bodies around a tree trunk. Clearly, hugging trees offers relief to koalas when temperatures rise.""",*Read the next two selections.

Recently, researchers spotted dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, doing something quite clever and unusual. The dolphins were using a tool to hunt for food.

2. Why would dolphins need a tool? And without hands, how would they use the tool? The answers show just how smart these animals are.

3. Dolphins need healthy food. However, the most nutritious fish often hide under the sand on the ocean floor. Typically, dolphins can locate these fish easily because a part of the fish's body creates an echo that dolphins can hear. But in Shark Bay, the bottom-dwelling fish do not have that body part. That means the fish are hard to find. Dolphins often cut themselves while using their noses to search for these fish that hide under the sand.

4. Amazingly, dolphins have found a way to solve this problem using a tool. The tool is a type of sponge that is found in the ocean. Many sponges are flat, but some are shaped like cones. The bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay look for the cone-shaped sponges. When they find one, they use their nose, or rostrum, to break it off.

5. After the sponge is detached from the seafloor, a dolphin is able to fit it over its rostrum. Researchers believe that these dolphins wear the sponges in order to protect their rostrums from injury. The jagged rocks and broken coral will not cut them as they hunt for food along the ocean floor. Researchers call this hunting technique ""sponging.""

6. Once a fish is scared out of hiding, it will dart around in the open water before reburying itself in the ocean sand. This behavior gives the dolphin time to shake off the sponge and catch the fish.

7. Scientists notice interesting behavior patterns among sponging dolphins. Mother dolphins are teaching their calves how to use sponges. Scientists also see that sponging dolphins tend to socialize with other sponging dolphins. They will continue to study dolphins in hopes of learning more about how dolphins think and behave.""",,Spongers of the Sea,,,,,,,,,,A Sponging Dolphin,"*Use ""Spongers of the Sea"" (pp. 11–12) to answer questions 11–14.

2019staargr5readingtest2,5,"""1. In the late 1700s and 1800s, Lakota Indians roamed the grassy western plains of the United States. Like many other American Indian tribes, the Lakota did not use writing. Still they wanted to remember important events. To do this, they made winter counts. A winter count is a piece of buffalo skin, cloth, or paper that is covered with small pictures. One picture marks each year since the winter count began.

2. This collection of pictures was called a winter count because the Lakota measured each year from the first snowfall of the season to the next year's first snowfall. The winter count helped the tribe keep track of what happened and when.

*The Keeper's Role*

3. Since the Lakota did not write their language, they passed down their history orally. Parents told their children about past events. When those children grew up, they told the same stories to their children.

4. In each Lakota community, there was one person who knew all the stories very well. This person was called the keeper. The community listened to the keeper when it wanted to know its history. Hearing about past events helped the members of a community learn ways to stay healthy, strong, and united against enemies.

5. The keeper was in charge of the winter count, which he kept among his personal belongings. He was the one who added a new picture each year. If the pictures on the winter count started to fade, he copied them onto a new one. When a keeper got old, he gave the winter count to his son, who became the community's new keeper. Keepers were almost always male.

6. Caring for the winter count was just one part of a keeper's job. His larger task was remembering the community's history. To do so, he had to remember hundreds of events, even things that had happened many years ago. The winter count, though important and useful, did not show details. Its drawings were very simple. They were meant to trigger memories, not serve as works of art. When a keeper saw a certain picture, it was supposed to make him think of all the important things that had happened during that year.

*Ordering the Years*

7. When it was time to add a new picture to a winter count, the keeper talked with the oldest and wisest members of the community. Together they decided which event should be drawn. The event had to be something many people had seen or known about. ""Black Crow won the battle"" might define one year. ""Many buffalo"" might mark another year as special.

8. Sometimes different keepers used the same event to mark a year. In 1833, many Lakota Indians saw a <u>spectacular<u> meteor shower. They watched as many shooting stars flashed across the night sky and appeared to drop to Earth. Four different keepers—American Horse, Rosebud, Lone Dog, and Flame—drew meteor showers on their winter counts that year. Each of the four pictures is different, but they all refer to the same event.

9. Not all of the pictures on winter counts were arranged the same way. Some winter counts had rows of pictures. On other winter counts, the earliest pictures were in the middle, and the more recent pictures circled outward. The pattern was not important; placement was what mattered. Each new picture had to be placed next to the one that had been painted the year before. The placement allowed a person to count backward to find out how long it had been since, for example, his community had made peace with another group. The winter count could also show people how old they were. If a woman had been born in ""the year when everyone was very sick,"" for example, she found that picture. Then she counted how many years had passed since then. In this way, the winter count served as a calendar.

*A New Purpose*

10. By the 1930s, most Lakota had learned to write, which gave them a new way to document their history. Winter counts were no longer necessary. Today only a few winter counts survive.

11. Many winter counts now hang in museums. They no longer perform the task of preserving a tribe's history. Their information, however, is still valuable. Historians have learned many things about the Lakota by studying their winter counts. For those who know how to read them, winter counts still have stories to tell.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2019staargr6readingtest,1,"""1. When she was just seven years old, Michelle knew with certainty that she wanted to be a photographer when she grew up. That year she received her first camera, a small disposable one to use on the family vacation. At first she randomly clicked the button, not giving much thought to what she was doing. When her father examined her blurred images and aimless shots, he advised Michelle to look through the lens and think about what the resulting picture would look like. The next day Michelle saw a family of ducks, and remembering what her father had said, she lay down on the ground and waited for a duckling to waddle near her. That picture still hangs on her bedroom wall.

2. Now, six years later, Michelle was attempting to <u>capture<u> a sunset for a local photography contest. She groaned as storm clouds rolled in before the sun had a chance to cast its vibrant colors across the sky.

3. ""Mom, I don't think I'm ever going to get this shot!"" Michelle complained, putting her camera equipment on the kitchen table and sighing with exasperation.

4. ""Still no luck?"" Mom asked. ""Why don't you use one of your previous photographs? You have some captivating pictures on the computer.""

5. ""I can't—the contest rules specifically say the photos have to be taken with a traditional camera, not a digital one. We turn in the roll of film, it gets developed, and then we choose which picture we want to enter into the contest, just to make sure everything is fair.""

6. ""I hope the weather clears up by the weekend, then, but I'm wondering why a sunset is so important,"" Mom mused.

7. ""The theme of the contest is tranquillity,"" Michelle explained. ""I have pictures of the cat lounging in the sun, light reflecting off the calm water in the pond—images like that. But honestly, I feel most peaceful when I study the colorful display of an evening sunset, and I'm hoping the contest judges will feel the same way when they see a picture of the sunset,"" Michelle said with another sigh.

8. Six-year-old Zach came out of his room when he saw Michelle. ""Hi! What are you doing? Are you going to take more pictures? You want to take a picture of me? Look!"" Zach put both arms over his head in a muscle-man pose.

9 ""Not right now, Zach,"" said Michelle, laughing at his juvenile antics. ""I have to do my homework and think about something besides the contest."" Zach frowned and went back into his room.

10. The next afternoon Michelle felt inspired when she saw clear skies, so she again set up her equipment on the hill behind her house as Zach ambled along beside her. Soon the sky glowed orange, gold, and pink as the sun drifted toward the horizon.

11. ""This is it, Zach,"" Michelle whispered hopefully as she carefully lined up her shot. ""If the colors show up just right, I think I'll have the winning picture.""

12. ""It's just a silly sunset. They happen all the time. I think you should take one of me . . . see, I can be peaceful."" Zach closed his eyes and lay on the grass.

13. Michelle grinned. ""Maybe tomorrow; I'm waiting till the sun reaches the ground. Right . . . about . . . now."" Michelle clicked the camera button. ""That was perfect!"" she exclaimed triumphantly. ""Let's go home.""

14. The next morning Michelle woke earlier than usual, pleased with her picture-taking accomplishments. Picking up her camera, she paused, noticing that she could take one more picture to complete the roll of film. She walked across the hall to Zach's room and stood outside the door. ""Hey, buddy, want me to take your picture now?"" When she heard nothing in response, she opened the door and peered inside. Zach, normally as active as a fly in a doughnut shop, was on his stomach sleeping quietly. Stuffed animals were scattered around him, a teddy bear was tucked under one arm, and a blanket was wrapped possessively around one foot. Sunlight cast its beam across his back. Carefully Michelle knelt down and took a picture. ""Mom will like this,"" she thought, as she shut Zach's door quietly.

15. A week later Michelle hurried her mother into the photo shop that was hosting the contest. The clerk handed her the envelope with her pictures in it and reminded her: ""Remember, there is a one picture maximum, and it must be from this group of photos.""

16. Michelle nodded as she moved to a table. Her hands trembled as she opened the envelope, and she began to look at her pictures one by one. The cat one was cheery; he certainly looked content. The pond picture was tranquil, too, with its still water. But the sunset picture was the one she was most eager to see. There it was: bright colors layered toward the sky, and the sun delicately balanced on the horizon. It was as near perfection as Michelle had dreamed it would be.

17. Then, as she casually glanced at the last photo, she paused. Her eyebrows rose as she studied the photo of Zach. She looked back at her photograph of the sunset, which suddenly seemed less perfect. She deliberated on the better choice until the clerk called for final submissions.

18. ""Here it is—my winning entry,"" Michelle announced, handing over the last picture of the bunch.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in the answer on your answer document.*,*A Picture of Peace*,1,"1. Read this sentence from paragraph 14.

2019staargr6readingtest,2,"""1. To humans the area where a recent forest fire occurred may seem <u>devastated.<u> Yet for some species of animals, it is a place full of promise for new life. As larger animals like deer and bears leave the forest to find new homes, the black-backed woodpecker often makes the forest its new home. Doing so helps restore life to the damaged forest.

*A Special Kind of Bird*

2. The black-backed woodpecker is a medium-sized bird found in Canada, Alaska, and parts of the northwest United States. Its dark colors make it hard for predators to detect among trees blackened by fire. This woodpecker relies on the
environment of the burned forest. It is mainly attracted to the area by a food source: the beetle.

3. After a forest fire certain types of beetles are attracted to the smoke and heat. They travel to the forest and move in. Here they dig into and eat the charred wood. Scientists believe that the black-backed woodpecker hears the activity and follows the beetles to the forest. With plenty of beetles to feed on, the woodpecker begins building a new home by drilling and pecking at a burned tree.

4. The black-backed woodpecker builds a home called a nest cavity. This nest is usually built inside a tree trunk or a fallen log. The bird has a pointy, hard beak
designed for drilling into wood. It also has a very thick skull bone and a strong neck. Both help it tolerate the constant pecking that is required to build its nest. Its feet feature sharp nails that allow the woodpecker to cling to the tree while it pecks away at its new home. The woodpecker can move into the nest cavity as soon as it is drilled. It will live in its home until it builds a new nest for itself the following year.

*Homes for All*

5. The black-backed woodpeckers are the home builders of the burned-out forest. They play a vital role in restoring the forest. The homes they build can be used by other birds. ""Woodpeckers are pathfinders,"" says Dick Hutto, a professor at the University of Montana who studies black-backed woodpeckers. ""They create the conditions that are going to be improved for birds four, five, six, seven years later. ""

6. As the black-backed woodpeckers abandon their nests, more and more animals are able to find homes as they return to the forest. More insects come to live in the trees, followed by
birds that eat the insects and, eventually, by bigger animals that eat the birds. In this way plant and animal life slowly returns to the forest.

*Bringing New Life*

7. Although natural areas burned by fire may not seem very lively, the black-backed woodpecker's drilling is not the only action taking place. The plentiful ash on the forest floor acts as a natural fertilizer. The ash helps bring about new growth. Plants blossom and provide fruits and seeds for the forest dwellers to eat. Other types of woodpeckers often live in burned forests too. Some finches, robins, and warblers move in, along with western bluebirds and mountain bluebirds. Amazingly even hummingbirds may live in burned forests. They can eat the flower nectar of the new plant growth.

8. The black-backed woodpecker does not stay in its new ""neighborhood"" for the rest of its life. It tends to live in the area for only three or four years. Then the woodpecker moves to another forest more recently affected by a fire. The hard work it has done, however, will benefit other animals for many years to come.

*Preserving Habitats*

9. Often when there is a forest fire, people may want to clean it up by removing some of the burned or dead trees. Some ecologists, however, say that taking away the burned trees is actually taking away the precious habitats of birds and other forest animals. For the black-backed woodpeckers, these trees are more useful burned and dead than when the trees were healthy and alive.

10. According to a 2014 article published by the Center for Biological Diversity and the John Muir Project, ""Burned forests are not dead zones, but rather teem with life."" Terry Rich, who works for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Idaho, encourages people to visit the forests that have experienced fires in the past. ""Go to the burned forests and see what you can see,"" he says.

2019staargr6readingtest,3,"""1. Texas pole-vaulter Charlotte Brown is reaching new heights. As a sophomore in high school, 15-year-old Brown competed in the pole vault at a state track-and-field meet in Texas in 2013. She finished eighth with a vault of 10 feet 6 inches. What makes this accomplishment even more notable is that Brown is legally blind. Because she could distinguish between light and dark, she and her coach developed a system that enabled Brown to vault competitively. Her coach would roll out some dark artificial turf alongside Brown's running lane. This allowed Brown to be able to run in a straight line. She also had to count her steps in order to know when to plant the pole and listen carefully as her coach told her when to jump.

2. In 2014, as a junior, Brown found herself in familiar circumstances. She had made it back to the state championships in the pole vault. Over the course of the year, though, Brown's vision had worsened. She could no longer discern the contrast between the dark turf and the runway. This meant that she had to develop new methods that would allow her to continue competing. Her coach now uses a whistle to keep her centered, and Brown uses a beeper that alerts her when to plant her pole.

3. Even though her eyesight has <u>diminished,<u> Brown continues to think positively. ""The bright side is, I'm already totally blind. I can't get any blinder. What I figure out now will work the rest of my vaulting career,"" she said after finishing fourth at the state meet with a jump of 11 feet.

4. ""I think a disability is something that stops you or limits you from being able to do the things that you want to do,"" Brown says. ""I think everyone struggles with something in life. This was my something."" As she thinks about the future, Brown clearly doesn't consider her blindness a disability. She is keeping an open mind about continuing competitive pole vaulting in college. She has even considered competing in the Olympics. She also envisions a career in teaching or coaching. With these goals in mind, Brown will surely continue to soar to new heights.""",*Read the next two selections.

2019staargr6readingtest,4,"""1. If there is one trait I have taken from my mother, it is her courage. Like most mothers, my mom wants the best for me. She encourages me to seize every opportunity and use it to its fullest potential. She has encouraged me to reach for those opportunities that may even seem impossible. After all, she does this every day.

2. When friends meet my mom for the first time they are often taken aback, and when they get me alone for a second, they scold me for not telling them my mom is in a wheelchair. It shocks them, and initially they don't want this emotion to show on their faces when they shake her hand and say hello.

3. In my defense, I never think to mention that my mom is in a wheelchair. She has been paralyzed from the waist down for most of her life, and all of mine. To me, though, she is just a regular mom. Like many of my friends' moms, she has always been there for me. When there were those moments as a child when I just needed to be held, I knew I could crawl onto my mother's lap and find comfort in her safe arms. When I needed a cheerleader on the sideline of my soccer games, she was always there. Mother, friend, confidante, teacher, nutritionist, chef, caregiver, banker, coach, consultant, and advisor—my mom has always been there for me. And when it was time to move out of the house, she was there helping me pack, hoping that everything I had learned from home would carry over into the next phase of my life. Like I said, just a regular, great mom.

4. On family vacations, my mother never sits out on an activity. Whether it means long arguments with hotel owners to create handicap accessible ramps or strapping herself to some stranger's lap in order to zip-line over the mountains of Costa Rica, we're all right there, helping her be a part of everything. Of course, there are some things that she can't do. She couldn't hike the volcano in Hawaii with the rest of the family or go cliff-jumping in Mexico. But she always tries. She goes as far as she can. No matter how good or bad the chances are of something working out in her favor, she always tries.

5. I have learned from watching my mom that if I don't have the courage to try, even if the chances of failure are great, I will also never succeed. My choices are infinite, and not just because of the opportunities I've had. They are without bounds because my mother showed me how to live outside of limits.""See It Through"" by Rachele Honcharik is excerpted from Bookmarked: Teen Essays on Life and Literature from Tolkien to Twilight, edited by Ann Camacho, copyright © 2012.

2019staargr6readingtest,6,"""1. On a dark May night in 1927, starlight flickered on the silver wings of a small plane as it sputtered on through the sky. Through the side window, the pilot could see the glow of the city of Paris. He glided over villages and farms, and then the large buildings of the city were beneath him. After circling the Eiffel Tower, he began searching for Le Bourget Airport. At last he was descending, following the lights of the runway. As he drew closer, he could see arms waving and hear 100,000 voices cheering. Charles Lindbergh breathed a sigh of relief as his wheels touched the pavement. After 33V2 hours in the air, he had done what no pilot had accomplished before. Lindbergh had crossed the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Paris in a single flight.

*Young Pilot*

2. At age 25 Lindbergh had already become known as an excellent pilot, at least in St. Louis, Missouri, where he lived at that time. A veteran of barnstorming, or trick flying, Lindbergh had also become the chief pilot for the airmail service between St. Louis and Chicago. But Lindbergh longed for more.

3. Lindbergh decided to accept a challenge offered by New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig in 1920. Orteig had challenged pilots to fly from New York to Paris in one trip. Several pilots had tried to make this flight and failed. Still Lindbergh and other pilots were preparing to attempt the challenge. Most were planning to fly large, sturdy planes with multiple engines. Lindbergh believed this was the wrong approach. A lighter, smaller plane, with only one person on board and a single engine, would conserve fuel and have the best chance of completing the trip.

*A Dream Becomes Real*

4. After speaking with some businessmen in St. Louis, Lindbergh convinced them to support his idea. They provided $15,000, and Lindbergh searched for a company to make his plane. Wherever he went, aircraft makers rejected his ideas. But at last, a small company agreed to build his plane. They believed in him and completed the project in only two months.

5. The plane, which Lindbergh named the _Spirit of St. Louis,_ had a unique design. Instead of placing the gas tank behind the pilot's seat, as was usually done, Lindbergh had it placed in front of him. He didn't want to be caught between the tank and the engine if the plane went down. However, this meant that Lindbergh would not be able to see out the front window. He didn't mind, though. ""There's not much need to see ahead in normal flight,"" he told the designer. In order to see, Lindbergh had to bank, or tilt, his plane slightly. If necessary, he could use a periscope, an instrument that helped him see objects outside the plane.

6. Having the lightest plane possible was very important. Instead of using a heavy pilot's seat, Lindbergh wedged a lightweight wicker chair into the plane. He packed only the items he considered essential—a raft, a knife, and a flashlight. His plane included a few tools, such as oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, and a compass. His efforts to rid the plane of any unnecessary weight also included trimming his flight maps and wearing specially designed lightweight boots.

7. Lindbergh made numerous short test flights in his new plane before flying from California to New York in only 20 hours and 21 minutes. With this, he set a new transcontinental record. When he reached New York City, he found several other pilots there, preparing for their flight to Paris. However, bad weather kept them from leaving.

8. On May 20, 1927, Lindbergh found a small break in the weather. Just after dawn he filled extra gas tanks with 450 gallons of fuel, placed them inside the plane, and took off. His plane wobbled on bulging wheels down the muddy runway.
""The _Spirit of St. Louis_ feels more like an overloaded truck than an airplane,"" he wrote. Although the wind was blowing in the wrong direction and the engine felt weak, Lindbergh urged the plane forward. At the last second, it lifted off. It cleared power lines by only 20 feet.

*The Flight*

9. Armed with only a few sandwiches and some water, Lindbergh was in for a 3,600-mile flight. He was already exhausted because he had not gotten any sleep the night before. He flew very low over land, ocean, and ice, navigating through fog and darkness. His compass and the stars guided him. His body grew stiff, and his legs and feet became cramped. At times he felt himself drifting off to sleep, so he opened the window and gulped in fresh air to make himself alert.

10. After 27 hours Lindbergh flew over some fishing boats. ""Which way is Ireland?"" he shouted, but no one answered. So he continued, gaining energy as he flew over Ireland, England, the English Channel, and France.

11. When Lindbergh finally arrived in Paris, the excited crowd lifted him up and carried him. Later royal leaders and the president of the United States presented him with awards. Lindbergh's incredible journey had made him an international star and inspired young dreamers everywhere.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2019staargr7readingtest,1,"""1. On an impulse, Saeng swung open the door and entered.

2. An elderly woman behind the counter looked up and smiled at her. ""Yes? Can I help you?"" she asked.

3. Saeng hesitated. Then she thrust out the heart-shaped green leaf in her hand and stammered, ""Do—do you have this plant? I—I don't know its name.""

4. The woman took the leaf and studied it with interest. ""Why, yes,"" she said. ""That looks like a rose of Sharon. We have several in the nursery out back.""

5. She kept up a steady stream of conversation as she escorted Saeng through a side door into an open courtyard, where various saplings and shrubs stood. ""Hardy plants, these roses of Sharon. Pretty blossoms, too, in the fall. In fact—look, there's still a flower or two left on this shrub. Nice shade of pink, isn't it?""

6. The leaves on the shrub were of the same distinct serrated heart shape, but its flower looked—wrong, somehow.

7. ""Is there—I mean, can it have another kind of flower?"" Saeng asked. ""Another color, maybe? I think—I think it was a deep color,"" she offered, then shook her head. ""I don't remember. It doesn't matter."" Discouraged and feeling more than a little foolish, she started to back away.

8. ""Wait,"" the florist said. ""I think I know what you're looking for."" A slow smile deepened the wrinkles in her face. ""Come this way. It's in our greenhouse.""

9. At the far side of the courtyard stood a shed, the like of which Saeng had never seen before. It was made entirely of glass and seemed to be bathed in a soft white light.

10. As she led the way there, the florist started talking again. ""Lucky we just got through moving in some of our tropical plants,"" she said, ""or the frost last weekend would have killed them off. Anything in there now you'd have to leave indoors until next summer, of course. Even so, some of the plants won't survive the long cold winters here. Hothouse flowers, that's what they are. Not hardy, like those roses of Sharon I just showed you.""

11. Only half listening, Saeng wished that there were a polite way she could excuse herself and leave. Still, she dutifully followed the other woman through the greenhouse door and walked in.

12. She gasped.

13. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random <u>profusion.<u>

14. ""Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?"" The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.

15. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom.

16. ""_Saebba,_"" Saeng whispered.

17. A _saebba_ hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew up the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.

18. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.

19. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel.

20. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. ""Madagascar periwinkle,"" its tag announced. _How strange to see it in a pot,_ Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.

21. And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it. _""Dok Malik,""_ she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, ""jasmine.""

22. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a _dok Malik_ bud into it.

23. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in answer on your answer document.*,"*from The Winter Hibiscus*

2019staargr7readingtest,2,"""1. Founded in 1869 by John James Sainsbury, Sainsbury's is one of England's oldest grocery <u>chains.<u> But its leaders have some modern ideas. Paul Crewe leads a continuous effort that is devoted to helping people ""live well for less."" This humble promise that led to efforts to eliminate food waste and create new energy sources is positively groundbreaking.

2. The revolutionary plan started with a simple idea—keep leftover food from getting into landfills. The dumping of organic waste into landfills is a problem everywhere. Every year more than a billion tons of food is wasted. All that organic material decomposes in landfills, which produces a by-product known as methane gas. This natural substance that is left over is released into the atmosphere. The excess amounts of this gas can have harmful effects. Sainsbury's management has developed a program that seeks to solve this gassy glut. Its organic waste does not go to landfills. Nor does the methane escape into the air. How does the grocery chain do it?

3. Offering shoppers the freshest and most appealing products possible is a good start. Attractive food sells the best. At the end of each day, each grocery store reduces the prices of fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy products. Cheaper food sells even better. Whatever edible food is left goes to charities for distribution to people who need it. Free food goes into bellies rather than the ground. Sainsbury's gives away large amounts of food to farmers to feed animals as well. Animals do not care if lettuce is wilted.

4. In spite of Sainsbury's efforts, a large volume of waste remains. A machine grinds the waste into a slushy goo, which is then poured into giant silos called anaerobic digesters (ADs). These giant silos act like artificial stomachs. Inside, microbes digest organic waste and produce methane bubbles. The same thing happens to organic waste in landfills and waste-trea
the AD silos are tightly sealed so they can capture and store the methane. The resulting biofuel can power vehicles, or it can be burned to produce electricity. Sainsbury's management estimates that its ADs can produce enough energy to power 2,500 homes for one year, or it can make enough electricity to completely remove one of its stores from the public power grid.

5. That is exactly what Sainsbury's has done at its store in Cannock, England. Special trucks collect food waste from more than 1,200 grocery stores all over England. They deliver the food waste to ADs in Cannock. Some of the methane trapped during the process fuels the trucks. The vehicles then go out to collect more waste. Much of the gas is burned to generate electricity. A long cable carries the power from the generators directly to the Cannock store. In the event that more power is generated than the store needs, excess power could be added back into the national power grid of England for people all over the nation to use. Another beneficial by-product of ADs is a solid waste called digestate. This gritty substance makes a rich fertilizer for local farmers to help grow better crops.

6. One of the best things about ADs is that their source is reliable. Every meal, whether it's eaten in a restaurant or at home, results in some food waste. Fortunately much of that garbage can be turned into a valuable raw material for making biofuel. Thus, the waste is no longer wasted.

7. So far Europe has mainly led the way in biofuel development. The continent has more than 14,000 digesters. Germany alone has 9,000 of them. But the United States is making rapid progress. In 2014 more than 2,000 anaerobic digestion plants were reported to be in operation around the country. And many more are set to begin processing food waste soon.

8. Many people may be unaware of efforts like those of the Sainsbury's company. But such programs seem to represent a growing trend. Increased knowledge and interest worldwide could lead to even bigger and bolder biofuel experiments in the near future.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2. Now imagine you are only as big as a person's thumb and weigh no more than a graham cracker. That's about the size of black-capped chickadees. These friendly little birds are often seen at bird feeders throughout the winter. They are plump-looking critters, with black, white, and gray feathers, and they live year-round in the forests of North America, from Alaska through Canada and across the northern states. Since they do not migrate to the tropics when the thermometer drops below freezing, black-capped chickadees have adapted to the cold in amazing ways.

3. Chickadees living near Fairbanks, in interior Alaska, experience -30° to -40°F on a regular basis, with temperatures sometimes plunging to -60°F or colder. Birds have a body temperature of about 104°F. This means that sometimes there is well over a 100-degree difference between a chickadee's body and the air temperature only an inch away.

4. Like all birds, chickadees have feathers, so in a sense, they wear little down parkas all the time. The colder the temperature, the more they fluff their feathers by sticking them out, away from their bodies. Feathers are the perfect insulation, trapping air between them and acting as a barrier between the cold outdoor weather and the birds' bodies.

5. Chickadees can fluff their feathers out to an inch thick—wider than their own bodies—to protect themselves against the cold. At extreme temperatures, they look like round, feathery balls.

6. But chickadees don't have feathers on their legs or feet, so how do they keep their tiny toes warm? They don't. Without any feathered insulation, heat would quickly be lost and much energy wasted in attempting to keep their toes as warm as the rest of the body. So they allow their feet to cool to just above freezing. This way, the rest of the chickadee doesn't get cold by having cold blood returning to the body from its legs.

7. But even such energy efficiency by itself is not enough to survive the frigid winter days. In the same way that we must burn more fuel in the winter to keep our houses warm, chickadees also need more fuel to stay warm. And what sort of fuel do chickadees burn? Food. As the days shorten, the temperature drops, and since chickadees forage only during daylight hours, they have the least amount of time to eat during the season when they need the most fuel. As soon as there is enough light to see by, they spend all of their time finding and eating as much food as possible until the light fades.

8. Chickadees begin preparing for winter while the green leaves of summer are still on the trees. They stash away bugs, seeds, or fat from dead animals, tucking these morsels into crevices in tree bark. The higher the fat content the better, since calories—the units of energy in food—are concentrated in fats.

9. To a chickadee, body fat is fuel. Since they don't have crops in which they can store food to eat later, they must eat enough each day to survive the long, 18-hour night. By feasting on fatty foods, chickadees can increase their body weight by about 8 to 10 percent—which would be like a 100-pound kid gaining 8 to 10 pounds in one day. Increasing their body fat during the day is like stoking the fire before going to bed. Throughout the night chickadees burn their recently <u>accumulated<u> fat, and by the next morning, none is left.

10. Even with their feathered insulation and daily storing away of fat, chickadees must still conserve as much energy as possible at night. They do not roost together in flocks as some birds do but spend the night alone. As darkness falls they cram themselves into little hollows in the trees. Once settled, they lower their body temperature, just as we lower the thermostat in our houses to save energy at night.

11. Although fragile in many ways, the tiny black-capped chickadee shows how tough it really is by surviving the bitterly cold winters of northern North America. The next time you see a chickadee visiting your bird feeder, just think, could you survive out there?""",*Read the next two selections.

2019staargr7readingtest,5,"""1. In 2000 a British bookstore owner named Stuart Manley made a discovery that would impact social media and the global market for years to come. While unpacking some old boxes, Manley found a World War II poster that the British government designed in 1939. The slogan and the simple design were intriguing, so Manley decided to hang the poster in his store. The poster read ""Keep Calm and Carry On."" Little did Manley know that the phrase would turn into a worldwide cultural phenomenon.

2. The Keep Calm poster that Manley discovered dates back to the start of World War II. With war quickly approaching, the British government designed three posters, each containing a motivational phrase. The posters were similar in appearance, with a special regal-looking font and a simple picture of King George VI's crown. Two of the three posters were displayed in public at the start of the war in order to raise the morale of the British people. But public response to the two posters was just mediocre, and the motivational campaign was abandoned. Although nearly 2.5 million copies of the Keep Calm poster had been printed, the British government decided not to release them. Instead the copies sat in storage until 1940, when most of them were recycled into other paper products. Manley's copy has become a rarity.

3. But how did the phrase on this poster become a worldwide motto that has been imitated, reproduced, and printed on just about every imaginable item that can be sold? Manley's poster began attracting the attention of customers in his shop, so he printed copies of the poster to sell. After he advertised the poster in a national newspaper, sales skyrocketed. Soon other companies began to sell products bearing the slogan.

4. It is difficult to identify exactly why the Keep Calm and Carry On motto has become popular. Shortly after the poster made its appearance in 2000, the world suffered an economic downturn, and morale was once again low.People were in need of something to boost their spirits, just as the people of England needed encouragement during World War II. The saying ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" seems to be the ideal slogan to bring courage and hope to people. Manley's wife, Mary, commented, ""I do think it's kind of helped people in a way. It's a great slogan. You can apply it to any kind of stress you're under.  It is a
great poster—great graphic, simple design.""

5. Besides the optimistic message, the simple design and understated tone of the poster helped lead to its popularity and marketability. Because it was cheap to reproduce and easy to customize, many companies capitalized on the appeal of the catchy slogan. The motto became trendy and could be spotted on mugs, T-shirts, and mouse pads.

6. Today the now-famous wartime slogan has been rewritten in different ways. Some people have created fun phrases like ""Keep Calm and Call Mom"" or ""Keep Calm and Eat a Cupcake."" Others have added sarcasm to the slogan by writing versions such as ""Now Panic and Freak Out"" or ""Keep Calm and This Poster Is Getting Old."" No matter the version or interpretation of the Keep Calm slogan, it is highly recognizable. Many online shopping websites continue to sell a variety of products with some form of the Keep Calm and Carry On slogan. And variations of the slogan show up on social networking sites daily.

7. Even though ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" was originally intended to quell fears during World War II, the phrase has been embraced as a part of current popular culture. Today, interpretations of the slogan are often lighthearted, but it is important to remember the significance of the motto's original intent.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

22. *PETE*: [ _Almost yelling._ ] Do you have any idea what it feels like knowing the most humiliating moment of your life is on video?

23. *ANGIE*: [ _Calmly._ ] No, I don't. I would never put myself in that position. And neither would 99 percent of the audience out there.

2019staargr8readingtest,1,"""1. There's a common expression, ""No pain, no gain,"" which means that achievement requires some sort of sacrifice—mental sacrifice, physical sacrifice—something. Little did I know how important that phrase would soon become in my life, all because of an invitation to witness, up close and personal, some of the most fascinating (and loveable) animals on this planet.

2. When my fourteen-year-old daughter, Claire, and I found out that we were going to Antarctica to visit with and study the emperor penguins, we were thrilled. We had entered and won an essay contest. The grand prize promised an almost unfathomable adventure: three weeks living aboard a Russian icebreaker ship near an icy, remote outpost called Snow Hill Island.

3. Getting to Antarctica is no small feat. It is extremely difficult to fly there, as the official population is zero. The few who are lucky enough to visit this most mysterious continent do so by ships.

4. This is where the ""pain"" comes in. You see, to reach Antarctica, ships must pass through a <u>notoriously<u> violent area of ocean called the Drake Passage, considered to be the roughest stretch of sea on the planet.

5. Walls of water thirty, sometimes forty feet high—tremendous towers of dark green, icy
two solid days. We would hold on to a railing inside the ship while being violently tilted to one extreme side, then to the other, and then back again. Over and over and over, nonstop. If not for the belt straps on our cabin bed, we would have flown up in the air as we tried to sleep.

6. My daughter and I knew about the Drake Passage and were as mentally prepared as we could be. We knew what waited at the end of the journey—the penguins—and so together we convinced ourselves it was all worth the pain. But as mentally prepared as we were, we also had to be physically aware, as well. It was important to always watch our footing as we crept to the dining room each day to carefully grab a quick meal before returning to our cabin to ride out the sickening, never-ending storm.

7. I started to wonder, ""Is this worth it? Will the gain be worth all of this struggle?""

8. Then, about two and a half days after entering the Drake Passage, the waters calmed. For the first time on our journey, we walked out on deck and felt the sweet bite of the cold, clean air on our faces.

9. Soon, we noticed small black specks on nearby pieces of floating ice. Emperor penguins! The closer our ship got, the more it seemed as if the animals were welcoming us—some of them actually beating their wings together, as if they were applauding our arrival.

10. Before long, we reached our final destination, and we were allowed to take our first ice walk. Across the crunchy surface, we could see hundreds of penguins in the distance, watching us as we watched them.

11. As we learned on board, their interest was to be expected. Penguins are extremely curious and not fearful of humans.

12. The next day, two helicopters that would take us from our ship to the base camp were assembled on the deck of the ship.

13. After landing, we were given instructions on ""penguin etiquette."" These were the basic rules: You can't touch a penguin, but they can touch you if they'd like. You can't crowd them, but they can crowd you if they so desire. And you always give them the right of way. Beyond those rules, we were free to explore, photograph, and observe to our heart's content.

14. We began the two-mile hike over the ice to the penguin colony.

15. Within several hundred yards, little clusters of emperors, perhaps ten or so
at a time, greeted us, sliding on their bellies and making their wonderful noises, sort of a nasally squeal. But the real treat still awaited: the colony.

16. As far as we could see, there were emperor penguins—tens of thousands of them, stretched out to the horizon line. It was breathtaking. Thousands of newly hatched chicks waddled among the adults, vying for attention.

17. We found a quiet piece of ice, sat down, and within minutes were surrounded by dozens of curious emperors. In some cases, their beaks were just inches from our noses.

18. One day, two adult emperors with their three chicks in tow approached Claire, who was resting on the ice. They left the chicks with her, as if she were the babysitter. Twenty minutes later they returned to collect the chicks. And I will never forget the penguin that, when I jokingly asked which way back to the helicopters, pointed a wing in the correct direction.

19. Every night aboard our safe and warm ship, we thought about what it takes to survive in Antarctica, an incredibly harsh place.

20. But each day on the ice, we also thought about the Drake passage, that monstrous body of water we had to endure to get where we were. Over the course of our visit, we came to respect and even revere the power of that sea.

21. We still talk about the penguins, as I'm sure we always will. But we talk about the Drake too. Both experiences were unforgettable, and one would not have been possible without the other.

22. No pain, no gain.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in the answer on your answer document.*,"*A Rite of Passage (and the Importance of Penguin Etiquette)*

2019staargr8readingtest,2,"""1. Yellowstone National Park extends across a unique area of land in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Thousands of geothermal vents that lie just below the earth's surface cover this vast region. Geothermal vents are deep holes in the ground that release built-up pressure in the form of steam and scalding-hot water. The temperature of the ground near these hot spots can rise to more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit. During a trip to Yellowstone, microbiologist Rusty Rodriguez noticed something peculiar. He observed many plants thriving in the searing soil despite these intense conditions. Rodriguez wondered how these plants were able to flourish in such extreme temperatures while other plants in similar or milder environments perish.

2. To solve this mystery Rodriguez took plant samples back to his laboratory for investigation. Under a microscope he saw tiny strands of fungi called endophytes living on the plants. Rodriguez's research revealed that the
endophytes made the plants better able to handle climate stressors such as drought, heat, and cold. Correspondingly, the plant provided sugar to support the existence of the fungi.

3. About 80 percent of the earth's plants have a strain of endophyte fungus living on them. However, in the last few decades the fungi have unintentionally been destroyed by pesticides and fertilizer. Rodriguez believed that if the fungi could somehow be added back to a plant, its natural protection could be restored.

4. Rodriguez extracted endophyte fungi from several native plants known for surviving extreme temperatures to create a mixture. He found that when the mixture is applied to seeds, plants become immune to many of the agricultural woes that plague farmers. When plants are restored with endophyte fungi, they are protected from heat or cold. They also require less water and fertilizer to grow. Overall, plants are much healthier and more resilient.

5. Rodriguez has tested his endophyte mixture on crops and achieved success. In 2012 the state of Michigan was experiencing severe drought and extreme temperatures. Corn and rice seeds were coated with Rodriguez's creation to see how they would endure such conditions. The results were overwhelmingly optimistic. Crop yields increased by 85 percent. In addition, the plants used between 25 and 50 percent less water than those not treated. Simply put, plants that had the mixture added to them were more inclined to tolerate drought than others.

6. Scientists are hopeful about the potential of endophyte fungi. Plants are easily protected from drought and other severe conditions when they are treated with this fungus. It is also a natural, nontoxic substance that does not harm plants or humans. Endophyte fungi could quite possibly be the key to providing sustainable crops for the future.",*Read the next two selections.

2019staargr8readingtest,3,"""1. Bacteria have a reputation for being harmful. However, not all bacteria are bad. Some food products, such as yogurt, contain good bacteria. The human body even stores bacteria that help us produce vitamins and fight diseases.

2. Dutch microbiologist Hendrik Jonkers studies bacteria. He also has researched how certain living organisms are able to heal themselves when injured. An octopus, for example, can grow a new arm if needed. When a bone breaks in the human body, it is able to repair itself. Jonkers wondered if bacteria could be used to ""heal"" nonliving substances in a similar way. He tested this theory by adding bacteria to concrete. He discovered that concrete may also be able to recuperate from damage.

3. Concrete is one of the most important building materials. It was even used by the ancient Romans to build massive structures such as the Colosseum. Today it is used to construct highways, bridges, and high-rise buildings. In fact, concrete demand has doubled in the last decade. Concrete production now accounts for 5% of the world's carbon emissions, which is harmful to the environment.

4. Despite its popularity, concrete cracks. When water gets inside the cracks, it weakens the composition of the concrete. Eventually the concrete must be repaired or replaced. In Europe the annual cost of maintaining concrete structures is billions of dollars.

5. Jonkers has developed a self-healing concrete, or bioconcrete, to help solve these problems. He combines concrete with bacteria that are naturally able to produce limestone, a hard rock. The bacteria are placed inside plastic capsules that are mixed into wet concrete. The bacteria can live in the hardened concrete for decades. When water enters through cracks in the concrete, the plastic capsules open, and the bacteria are released. As the bacteria grow and multiply, they form limestone, which fills in the cracks.

6. In 2011 self-healing concrete was used to construct a lifeguard station near a lake in the Netherlands. Lifeguard stations are susceptible to damage by water and weather. With the help of Jonkers' bioconcrete, the lifeguard station has remained intact. Bioconcrete has been used on the floors and roofs of parking garages. It has even been used to reconstruct a canal and irrigation system in Ecuador.

7. While bioconcrete has its advantages, it is 50 percent more costly to create than traditional concrete. This makes the product unappealing to some people in the construction industry. Still, Jonkers believes the initial investment is worth the long-term savings and advantages it will provide.

8. Bioconcrete will reduce the need for repairs and making new concrete. In return, this will help manufacturers save money over time, and it will help lessen the amount of carbon pollution. Jonkers says, ""I think it's a really nice example of tying nature and the built environments together in one new concept.""",,The Cure for Concrete,,,,,,,,,,"Brilliant Ideas Smart Discoveries in Science In this issue: The Cure for Concrete September 2015; The Colosseum in Rome, Italy, is almost 2,000 years old.; Hendrik Jonkers with a Slab of Bioconcrete",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2019staargr8readingtest,5,"""1. The typical person is bombarded by hundreds of logos each day. We see them on signs, vehicles, television, and even on the clothes we wear. Logos are distinct images used to represent brands. There are logos such as the famous Nike ""swoosh,"" the colorful rings to identify the Olympic Games, and the United States Postal Service eagle emblem, just to name a few. All of these logos are designed to attract our attention. They also help us remember a product or service connected to that image. However, research conducted at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) supports the idea that remembering what a logo looks like is a very difficult task.

2. In 2015 researchers at UCLA gave 85 students a simple assignment. They had to draw the Apple logo purely from memory. Most of the students were Apple users, so they had the opportunity to look at the logo every day. Surprisingly, only one student in the study could accurately draw the logo from memory. Many of the sketches the other students made were flawed. Some of them drew the basics right but missed minor details of the design—no bite out of the apple or the wrong number of leaves. At first the researchers thought the problem might be that the students were just not very good at drawing.
They decided to ask the students to look at several different images and choose the logo that was most accurate. Less than half of the students could detect the correct image.

3. The UCLA Apple study is not the first time our ability to remember the details of images has been tested. In the 1970s researchers asked a group of people to draw a penny from memory. Participants were instructed to show the images and words just as they appear on the coin. Like the Apple study, most people could not precisely depict the image. Participants were unable to correctly identify which way Lincoln was facing or where the word ""Liberty"" was placed on the coin. While the penny is not technically a logo, it is an object with which people have frequent interaction. So why is it so difficult for people to recall the details of images, such as logos, that they see every day? Researchers have developed a theory they think might help to explain this blind spot in our memories.

4. Logos are typically designed to be simple and easy to recognize with a quick glance. Yet the frequent exposure to these logos can actually make our brains overlook them. This process is known as ""attentional saturation."" It would be challenging to try to remember every single thing that crosses our path. We take in so much information every day that the brain works to spot information that does not need to be stored. It allows this unimportant information to fade from our memory. Our brains actually signal us to ignore information we do not think we will need to remember.

5. The details of product logos are just the kind of information our brains tell us we do not need. This may be discouraging to logo designers and to companies that use these eye-catching logos. But there are still many business experts who believe in the importance of a recognizable logo.

6. Even though the brain is accustomed to ignoring unnecessary details, it is also programmed for recognition. When we see images such as logos over and over again, we become familiar with them. This constant exposure leads to something scientists refer to as gist memory. ""Gist memory"" means that our brain remembers the basic idea without all of the details. This general sense of memory has its own benefits. When we see that ""swoosh"" or the apple with a bite out of it, we are acquainted with the image. We may not be able to draw a perfect outline of the logo, but we are able to recognize the image. When people are able to recognize an image, it can make them feel like they really know the product behind the logo. In fact, familiarity with a <u>prevalent<u> logo can even make people feel more comfortable about purchasing or using certain products.

7. Logos are everywhere we look today. A fancy design or a thoughtful color combination may be a good start for a logo concept, but there are other factors to consider. Those establishing a logo need to know that people will only remember what they believe is worthwhile. A clever design may be interesting, but most people will forget the details—especially if our brains have anything to say about it.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2019staargr8readingtest,6,"""1. It was Friday afternoon, and another week of school was finally over. Andy weaved his way through the crowded hall, trying to avoid colliding with students at their lockers getting books and backpacks. He walked out the nearest exit and headed for the student parking lot, where he would wait for his best friend Broden.

2. While Andy waited at Broden's car, he studied the fabrics and colors of the other students' clothes. Everyone wore the same basic outfit—jeans and some sort of shirt. Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing flashy or stylish. Being from a family of tailors, Andy had learned a lot about clothing over the years—how to make it and how to alter it. But Andy wanted to be more than just a tailor.

3. Broden dropped Andy off at his father's tailor shop. Andy watched his father—pins in his mouth, measuring tape draped around his neck—expertly hem and repair Mr. Simone's pants.

4. Mr. Simone paid his bill and then carefully, almost proudly, placed the newly perfected pants over his arm. Andy thought he detected a spring in Mr. Simone's step as he left the shop. Andy watched Mr. Simone as he laid the pants on the backseat of his car, smoothing them so that they wouldn't wrinkle. There was no denying that tailoring was a valuable service to some. But to Andy his family's business seemed like a whole lot of tedious busywork: hemming pants, shortening the length of sleeves, taking in or letting out a waistline, replacing buttons, hooks, or snaps.

5. Andy's father peered over his eyeglasses, studying Andy as Andy observed Mr. Simone. ""Often, when people look better, they act better too. When people know they look good, they are more comfortable, less worried,"" Andy's father explained.

6. Andy knew that his father had a point. That was exactly the reason Andy longed to create something of his own. Something different. Something _exceptional._

7. ""Well that's it for today,"" said Andy's father, flipping the sign on the door to the CLOSED side and letting out a tired but satisfied sigh in response to a long workday. ""There's something I want to give you, Andy,"" he said as he beckoned for Andy to follow him to the back room. On the corner of a large worktable sat a bulky antique sewing machine, a retro model that looked very different from the modern one Andy's father used. ""I was your age when my father gave this to me, and now I'm giving it to you.""

8. Andy eyed the old machine appreciatively. ""Thank you, Dad. This is perfect!""

9. Andy wanted to use the sewing machine right away, but first he needed to draw his clothing design. He needed a design that was stylish yet original. Fortunately he wasn't starting with a blank page. Andy had been sketching designs as long as he could remember. Sometimes he drew in Ms. Greene's art class; sometimes he drew during lunch. Mostly he drew during the free minutes of his day, when he could empty his mind and just trust his charcoal pencil.

10. A visit to the fabric store that weekend turned into an expedition as he hunted down the perfect textiles for his creation. ""Your father doing something special?"" asked the owner.

11. ""It's for a school project,"" Andy replied. It wasn't exactly a lie. On his way back home, he looked at what people were wearing, the parade of pants, shirts, dresses, jeans, and ordinariness.

12. Andy began working that same night, losing himself in lines and folds, ripping out stitches and redoing them. It took over a week, but after multiple fittings and adjustments, his outfit was ready for its debut.

13. On Monday morning, Andy walked into school anticipating the glowing admiration of his fellow students. As he walked down the hall, heads turned. Teachers moved aside, guys pointed at him, and girls covered their mouths to hide their laughter.

14. Even Broden looked at him sympathetically. ""Was this a dare or something?"" he whispered to Andy at their lockers.

15. A morning full of whispers, jeers, and awkward questions left Andy slumped in his seat in art class like a spent parachute. Although he had <u>donned<u> his creation proudly that morning, he now wished he had a change of clothes.

16. ""It hasn't been a great day, huh?"" asked Ms. Greene, sitting beside him.

17. ""I've had better,"" Andy replied glumly.

18. ""You know, it's fine to want to do something different—you just have to be prepared for the consequences. Not everyone is going to see things the way you do—not right away, and maybe not ever.""

19. ""They don't know anything about fashion,"" Andy snipped.

20. ""Well, people like different styles,"" Ms. Greene responded. ""As for me . . . I like your incredible fabric choice. Think of this outfit as just the beginning; think of it as your first draft. The most famous designers didn't build their clothing empires on one outfit—especially their first.""

21. Andy knew she was right, of course. But still, he hadn't thought his design would warrant such ridicule. He sighed as he rose from his chair, putting his sketch pad and pencils into his backpack. ""A first draft, huh?"" he thought. And then he remembered what his English teacher Mrs. Ford always said: your first draft is just the beginning.

2022-released-items-ela-g3,1,"""1 ""Want to go to the pool tomorrow?"" Rosa asked Stephanie during recess. The pool at the YMCA was one of their favorite places.
  
  2 Rosa and Stephanie did everything together. They rode the school bus together. They sat together during lunch. They took dance lessons together and even went to the same summer camp. They were best friends. Most of the time.
  
  3 Sometimes, though, when Stephanie was with other friends, she ignored Rosa or treated her like a little kid, even though they were the same age. Rosa and Stephanie had played together since they were babies, but sometimes Stephanie didn't act like a friend.
  
  4 Today was one of those times.
  
  5 ""Sorry. I'm already going to the pool,"" Stephanie said. ""Toni and Vanessa and I are going."" She smiled, but it wasn't her nice smile. She walked away to join Toni and Vanessa, and Rosa was left standing alone.
  
  6 After school, at dance class, Stephanie talked and giggled with the other dancers as they stretched in front of the mirror. Rosa wanted to join them, but she still felt too upset.
  
  7 Then she noticed Kiara, the new girl, standing with one leg up on the barre. Rosa joined her and began stretching, too. Kiara smiled, and Rosa smiled back. Rosa tried not to check the mirror to see if Stephanie had noticed. _I hope she feels left out_, Rosa thought.
  
  8 The next morning, when Rosa boarded the bus, Stephanie was waiting in their usual seat. Stephanie quickly moved her backpack off the seat to make room for Rosa. But Rosa walked past her and slid into the empty seat next to Kiara. _How does it feel now?_ Rosa thought.
  
  9 On the bus ride, Rosa discovered that Kiara was not the quiet girl Rosa had thought she was. She talked a lot—about her little brother, about the tree house her uncle had built, and even about swimming.
  
  10 ""I love swimming!"" Rosa said.
  
  11 ""Me, too,"" Kiara said. ""We just joined the YMCA. My dad said he'd take my brother and me tonight.""
  
  12 ""It's awesome there,"" Rosa said. ""Sometimes the lifeguards put giant floats in the pool to climb on and slide off. I want to have a pool party there for my birthday this year!""
  
  13 ""Maybe you can come with us tonight,"" Kiara said. ""I'll ask my dad.""
  
  14 ""Thatt would be fun. I'll ask my mom,"" said Rosa.
  
  15 When they stepped off the bus, Stephanie was waiting on the sidewalk. ""Did you still want to go swimming tonight?"" Stephanie asked Rosa.
  
  16 _Here's my chance_, Rosa thought. ""I'm already going,"" she said. ""Kiara and I are going together."" She smiled. Somehow she knew it wasn't her nice smile. There, she thought.
  
  17 Stephanie nodded and looked at her feet.
  
  18 Rosa's heart sank and her cheeks began to burn.
  
  19 Why didn't she feel happy? Getting even is what she'd wanted, wasn't it?
  
  20 _I could walk away with my new friend and not look back, Rosa_ thought. But it was too late. She had seen Stephanie's face. Getting even didn't feel the way she'd expected. It didn't feel good at all. ""Um,"" she said instead, ""maybe we could all go together.""

2022-released-items-ela-g3,2,"""1 Psssst! Your friend leans close and whispers a secret. Woof! Woof! His dog barks as a car zooms past. Beep beep! The driver honks her horn to say hello. People and animals and things are making sounds all the time. I hear birds singing. Is that rumbling sound thunder? Some sounds are as quiet as a leaf rustling in the breeze. Others are so loud you might cover your ears.
  
  2 Pluck a guitar string or a rubber band stretched between your fingers. You see the string or rubber band go back and forth very fast. It is vibrating. You can't see it, but the vibration makes waves in the air, like you make waves in a bathtub of water when you waggle your hand up and down quickly.
  
  3 Every sound is made by vibrations. Place your fingertips lightly on the front of your throat. Say or shout a few words. Feel the tiny, quick, shaking movements? That is the vibration of the vocal cords in your throat. It makes the sound of your voice.
  
  4 Your ears are sound wave collectors. Sit very quietly. Listen to all the different sounds you can hear.
  
  5 The sound waves your ear collects travel through your ear canal. At the end of the canal is a thin piece of skin called your eardrum. The sound waves make your eardrum vibrate. Special nerve hairs further inside your ear pick up the vibrations. They send signals to your brain. Your brain makes sense of all the sounds you hear. The faster your eardrum vibrates, the higher the sound you will hear. If the vibration is slower, you will hear a lower sound.
  
  6 Sound waves travel not only through air but also through water. They can even travel through solid things, like wood. Knock on your table top. Listen to the sound. Now put one ear down on your table and knock again the same way. Does the knock sound different? Sound waves are traveling to your ear through the table top. They travel even faster through wood or metal than they do through air.
  
  7 In outer space, there is no air. And guess what. There are no sounds, either, because there is nothing for sound waves to travel through. If an astronaut bangs a hammer on the outside of a spaceship, people inside the spaceship may hear it. But there will be no sound outside the ship—no matter how hard the astronaut hammers! Because there is no air, the hammering creates no sound waves. There is only silence.
  
  8 Sometimes your ear collects a sound twice. If you make a wave of water in the tub, it will go to the edge and bounce back. Sometimes sound waves bounce back, too. If you clap your hands in an empty room, you hear the clap as soon as your hands come together. But you may hear it again, a split second later, as the sound waves travel to the wall and bounce back to your ear. It's called an echo.

  2. Whatever their talents, the following fathers are fabulous! 
  
  *Suck Them Up and Spit Them Out*
  
  3. Most fish do not live in family groups, but in the Red Devil Cichlid families of Central America, fathers help take care of their young. If a little one swims too far away, it's his dad's job to put him back into place. He gently grasps the wandering fish in his mouth and—aaapooey! He spits the young wanderer back with his brothers and sisters.
  
  *Excuse Me, I've Got a Frog in my Troat*
  
  4. If you were a Darwin's frog father with 20 or 30 babies to protect, where would you keep them? In your throat, of course! This South American dad picks up the young ones with his tongue and slides them through slits in his vocal sacs. As the babies grow, they push on Dad's throat and prevent him from croaking. Finally, when the babies are big enough, they crawl out of Dad's throat and hop away. (In case you were wondering, there are times when Dad accidentally swallows one. Oops!)
  
  *Piggyback Nursery*
  
  5. Where does the mother giant water bug lay her eggs? On the father's back! She attaches the eggs with a sticky material called an egg pad. When she's done, the father swims away and does all the caregiving. He visits the water's surface so the eggs can get air and uses his hind feet to clean the eggs. Once the babies are on their own, the father rubs off the sticky egg pad.
  
  *Cold Feet, Big Heart*
  
  6. In the chilly Antarctic, a mother Emperor penguin lays an egg. She must find a warm place for it before it freezes. Dad to the rescue! The pair works carefully to roll the egg to the top of his feet. He covers it with a flap of thick belly skin. The mother penguin then leaves for 2 months. She travels to open hunting waters that are over 50 miles away. In the meantime, the father keeps the egg on his feet. He doesn't eat. He doesn't drink. He just huddles together with the other fathers to keep their eggs warm. When the egg hatches, the chick stays cozy in the same place—on Dad's feet, under a layer of skin. Soon after, the mother returns and takes over while Dad goes hunting.
  
  *Sly Teacher*
  
  7. For the red fox, raising babies is a team effort. The mother stays in the den to keep the young, called kits, warm. The father brings the mother food every 4 to 6 hours until the kits are old enough to roam outside. To teach them how to find their own food, the father red fox buries extra meat near the den and hides it with twigs.""",*Read this article. Then answer questions 1 through 6.*,"*Fabulous Fathers*

2022-released-items-ela-g4,2,"""1. I always knew that I wanted to be a writer. Before I learned to write, I listened carefully to stories read to me, then I retold them to my friends. But I let out things I didn't like, and added my own ideas. (I also added plenty of monsters to make things more interesting.) By the time I was done changing things, my stories didn't always make sense. But they were exciting—and my friends enjoyed them. I still do this today: I retell folktales or myths or legends in new, exciting (I hope!), but sensible ways.
  
  2. When I learned how to write, I decided that I wanted to be a writer more than anything else. The first ""books"" I wrote were little Christmas or birthday stories for my family and friends. They were written on sheets of lined paper that I stapled together. This was before we had computers, so I had to write my stories over and over to make extra copies.
  
  3. I liked my stories to have pictures, but I wasn't good at drawing. Happily, my brother Daniel loved to draw. So he did pictures for my ""books."" Now he is a full-time book illustrator. We have published nine books together over the years.
  
  4. When I was in second grade, I wrote a story about a magician called ""The Great Yami Yogurt,"" who used the magic word ""Yazam!"" All his magic went wrong. He'd try to make flowers, but they'd turn into monsters. With my mother's help, I sent the story to an editor at Random House, because I thought my story was funny and good enough to make into a book.
  
  5. The editor at Random House didn't buy my story. But she wrote in a letter, ""Keep trying, and one day you will be published."" That was the best advice I could have gotten. Now I tell young writers, ""Keep trying. If you work hard and make your writing the best you can, you'll be published too.""
  
  6. I had my first story printed in a newspaper when I was in third grade. It was in the ""Kids' Corner"" of the Oakland Tribune in California, where I live. My story was about knights and dragons. Suddenly, I was a published writer! But I was in college before I had my first real book published. I wrote three stories for which my brother painted or drew pictures. No editor liked these. But on our fourth try, an editor finally said, ""Yes."" Our first book, _The Legend of Scarface: A Blackfeet Indian Tale,_ was published a year later—my childhood dream come true!
  
  7. However long it takes, there are great rewards. I still get a thrill when I hold the first copy of a new book of mine, or read one of my stories in a magazine or newspaper. My writing has led to many wonderful moments. When I first saw the movie _Mulan,_ the best moment came at the end, when the words appeared on the screen, ""Based on a story by Robert D. San Souci.""
  
  8. I never met the editor who told me to keep writing, but she was a friend to me. She knew I was serious, and she took the time to encourage me. And, because you are reading this article, I know you are serious about your writing. So now it's my turn to encourage you. It may be a short journey or a long one to becoming a published writer.

2022-released-items-ela-g5,1,"""1 The West African Harmattan whipped up a billow of dust. Suddenly Sali spied a scrap of glorious orange damask cloth turning in the hot wind like a flame. She followed as it danced down a street she didn't know very well. She skipped over holes and skirted people on chairs.
  
  2 All at once the wind died down, and the scrap settled gently on the scratchy, sandy road. 
  
  3 Sali picked up the cloth and gazed at it with admiring eyes. She turned it this way and that in the sun and imagined herself in a flowing dlokibani made of such cloth. This was a treasure, and she would take it home for her little wooden doll. It would surely make a lovely headpiece for that lucky one.
  
  4 Sali wandered back the way she had come, slowly now. At the corner of the street, she passed the table vendor, who was selling his dusty packets of tea and two-pill packs of aspirin. She passed Ami's mother, roasting peanuts and selling them by the handful. She turned onto the larger street and passed a plastic-goods store that displayed rows and rows of brightly colored plastic plates, bowls, and teapots. She glanced into the next shop and then stopped short. It was a fabric shop! There on the high counter was an entire bolt of the same wondrous cloth she held in her hand! 
  
  5 The next day Sali went back to the cloth shop. She stood near the door and watched the storekeeper. He measured and cut, as one person after another bought pieces of cloth. Her prized orange damask was back on a high shelf to the rear of the store.
  
  6 After a while the shopkeeper looked at Sali. ""Why do you stand so long at the door?"" he asked.
  
  7 Sali took a deep breath and said, ""I would like to help you in the store till I could earn enough of that orange cloth to make a dlokibani for myself.""
  
  8 The orange fabric glowed in a shaft of light from the uncovered bulb at the back of the store.
  
  9 ""That is very special and expensive cloth, little one,"" the shopkeeper told her.
  
  10 So she swept the courtyard and threw away scraps. She pushed big rolls of cloth back and forth. She ran to buy cough drops and peanuts and kola nuts for the shopkeeper. For days and days she worked.
  
  11 Finally, one day the store owner lifted down the lustrous roll of orange damask and measured out several yards. ""You've worked well for this cloth, Sali,"" he said. ""I thank you.""
  
  12 Sali rushed straight home with her treasure. Carefully she placed the cloth in her trunk.
  
  13 But how was she to get the dloki made? Sali did not know how to sew. Her mother always had their clothes made by a tailor who sat in a tiny shop several blocks from their house.
  
  14 Sali went and stood under a tree near the tailor's shop. She watched the people come and go. The tailor would whip out his measuring tape and see how tall the people were, how fat they were, how long their arms, how short their necks. He measured every part of them.
  
  15 After almost a whole day the tailor noticed Sali.
  
  16 ""What are you doing there, little girl?"" he asked.
  
  17""I have some beautiful cloth,"" she said, ""and I want it sewn into a dlokibani. Could I work for you to pay for sewing it into a robe for me?""
  
  18 The tailor agreed. Once again Sali worked for days and days. She swept and fanned the tea coals and held scissors and brought thread. At last, the tailor said, ""Bring me the cloth, Sali.
  
  19 Sali rushed home and brought back the satiny, shining cloth. She also brought her doll, its small head still neatly wrapped in the swatch of orange. The tailor took his tape and measured Sali, shoulder to ankle, shoulder to elbow, left shoulder to right shoulder. Then he started cutting the billows of orange fabric. 
  
  20 The next day was an important holiday called Tabaski. Drums were beating in many neighborhoods. Relatives and friends came to visit Sali's family. Sali slipped quietly away. Soon her mother missed her. ""Now where has Sali gone?"" she exclaimed. 
  
  21 Just then, Sali walked in, proudly wearing a beautiful orange dloki with a matching headdress. In her arms she carried her doll, dressed exactly as she was!""","*Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 7.*

2022-released-items-ela-g5,2,"""1 It was no surprise that Janet Guthrie excelled at one of the most dangerous sports on Earth. She had always loved adventure and daring new experiences. 
  
  2 Janet was born on March 7, 1938, in Iowa City, Iowa, and lived on a farm for the first few years of her life. Her father, an airline pilot, later moved the family to South Florida, where Janet took up flying. 
  
  3 At 13, she had already flown an airplane. At age 16, Janet decided she wanted to try a free-fall parachute jump. In free-fall, the parachutist jumps out of a plane without opening the chute. After falling several hundred feet at more than 100 miles an hour, the cord is pulled to open the chute. Then, if all goes well, the parachutist floats safely to the ground. 
  
  4 Her father wouldn't hear of it. ""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""No free-fall!"" 
  
  5 But Janet persisted. Finally, her father gave in. ""Just one time,"" he said, ""but you have to be careful and do it the right way."" 
  
  6 He would allow her to jump only on two conditions: He would fly the plane and she would receive parachuting lessons before the jump. 
  
  7 Since there were no parachuting schools in South Florida at the time, Janet's father hired a pro to give her private lessons. In her autobiography, _Janet Guthrie—A Life at Full Throttle,_ Janet said the pro taught her how to pull the rip cord that opened the chute, how to absorb the shock after landing, and how to fasten the helmet so it wouldn't fly off.
  
  8 By the time she was 21, she had earned a commercial pilot's license. She flew whenever she could break away from her classes at the University of Michigan.
  
  9 After graduating, Guthrie got a job as a physicist in the aerospace industry. She saved her money for an entire year and bought a car. Guthrie wasn't satisfied with just any car. She chose a Jaguar XK 120—the sleek and popular sports car that she had dreamed about since she was a teenager.
  
  10 At first, Guthrie enjoyed just driving the car around Long Island, outside New York City. Then she heard about a local sports car club where members could compete. She loved her car and wanted to see how it would do on a track. Soon she was entering races—and winning them. 
  
  11 Excited by her success, Guthrie attended a driving school in Connecticut. She was a natural. Her instructor, veteran driver Gordon McKenzie, liked the way she handled her car. He suggested she try auto racing. 
  
  12 A thrill shot through Guthrie. What a great idea. Off she went to enroll in a racing car drivers' school sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America. Guthrie swapped her Jaguar for a higher-priced model built especially for racing—the XK 140. Before long she taught herself how to take apart and rebuild its engine like a pro.
  
  13 Guthrie's career started to pick up speed. 
  
  14 She entered races all over the United States, finishing in some of the country's most celebrated long-distance competitions. In 1973, she won the North Atlantic Road Racing Championship. A champion, yes, but a tired champion. By then she had been racing for 13 years. She was exhausted, broke, and thinking of leaving the sport. 
  
  15 That's when she got the phone call. Someone named Vollstedt was asking her to drive his car in the 1976 Indy 500. No woman had ever driven in that race. _This has to be a prank,_ thought Guthrie. But Vollstedt, an auto designer and builder from Oregon, wasn't kidding. Could she drive a ""championship"" car? That was the big question. 
  
  16 With their open cockpits, wide wheelbases, and rear engines, championship cars were much different than the closed sports cars Guthrie had been accustomed to driving for many years. 
  
  17 ""Before she would agree to drive for me,"" Vollstedt said, ""she wanted to see if she could handle the car.
  
  18 Vollstedt was wondering the same thing, too. He arranged for a secret test at the Ontario Motor Speedway near Los Angeles. 
  
  19 To get into top physical shape for Vollstedt's test, Guthrie did exercises in front of her TV. One day she lost her balance, landed hard on her left foot, and fell to the floor. The doctors told her she had broken a bone and they put her foot in a heavy cast. _How am I going to drive a racing_ car? she worried. _Will I miss my big chance?_ 
  
  20 Broken ankle and all, Guthrie stepped into an unfamiliar car. She hit the accelerator. When her car got up to speed, Guthrie couldn't believe the feeling. ""What a thrill,"" she said. ""It was like going to the moon."" 
  
  21 Vollstedt was impressed with her time—an average speed of 178.52 miles per hour and a top speed of 196 mph. 
  
  22 Test passed. 
  
  23 She had showed Vollstedt she could drive the car. Now she had to show the rest of the world.""",*Read this article. Then answer questions 8 through 14.*,"*""Janet Guthrie: Lady in the Fast Lane "" from Profiles in Sports Courage*

2022-released-items-ela-g5,3,"""1 It was the early morning hours in Buffalo, New York. Trouble was brewing. Temperatures had plummeted and strong squalls began to blow across neighboring Lake Erie. Even though it was October, snow was falling faster than an inch per hour by the next afternoon.
  
  2 The storm, called the ""October Surprise"" by locals, caught the Buffalo area off-guard. In a very short period of time, up to 27 inches of heavy snow fell. The snow damaged trees and power lines, shutting down electricity and blocking roads. 
  
  3 This storm was the result of a phenomenon called ""lake-effect snow."" It's one of the main reasons why areas near big lakes, like the Great Lakes, get such remarkable snowstorms. Such storms usually occur between November and February, not October. It just so happened that all of the ingredients for lake-effect snow came together in a remarkable way that October. 
  
  
  4 Lake-effect snow forms when cold air passes over the warmer waters of a lake. Water holds on to heat more than air. As a result, below freezing air often passes over much warmer water. This causes some lake water to evaporate into the air and warm it. This warmer, wetter air rises and cools as it moves away from the lake. When it cools, it dumps all that moisture on the ground. If it's cold enough, that moisture becomes snow. 
  
  5 If the winds and temperatures are right, the air acts like a big sponge that sops up water from the lake and wrings it out on land. The direction of the wind is important— if the wind is blowing in a direction that covers more of the lake, the air will take in more water. The greater the temperature difference the more water the air will take in.
  
  6 All that water picked up from the lake normally travels no farther than about 25 miles away before falling, but it can sometimes travel as far as 100 miles away! That moisture can make for a whole lot of snow. Luckily for people living near large lakes, lake-effect snow generally slows down around February. That's when the lakes freeze over, making it impossible for the air to steal moisture away from the lake. 
  
  7 Not surprisingly, Buffalo is one of the snowiest cities in the country. Conditions are frequently right for lake-effect snow. To many who live there, massive snowstorms are a regular part of life. But don't think you could get more snow days by moving to an area that experiences lake-effect snow. People there are well trained in snow removal!""",*Read this article. Then answer questions 29 through 35.*,"*What Is Lake-Effect Snow?*

2022-released-items-ela-g6,1,"""1 I walked outside and was disappointed to find people weren't already pouring in at the entrance—and more disappointed that Connor wasn't out there. Around ten o'clock, a few people trickled in. As the morning wore on, the trickle became a steady flow. 
  
  2 The Flap-Jackeroos started playing on the newly cleaned stage around noon. I had no idea what to expect of breakfast entertainers, but they weren't bad. And except for a song about bacon or eggs benedict thrown in here and there, they mostly played normal country music. 
  
  3 By late afternoon, the parking lot was fuller than it had ever been. I wandered around, enjoying the festivities and talking to the vendors^1 about their art. 
  
  4 I found Zion, and we ate an obscene amount of junk food together in the rodeo arena. He was normally so strict about what he ate, so I was glad to see him relax a bit about that. 
  
  5 We watched the large group of kids in the petting zoo. Some of them even gave Spaghetti a little attention, though he didn't seem to care much.
  
  6 I introduced Zion to Josephine and Henry, shot a rubber snake at the shooting range, and even stuck my face through a wooden painting of a cactus so Zion could take a picture. . . . 
  
  7 At six o'clock, I left Zion and made my way into the apartment to get changed for the evening events. Mom and I had gone shopping together the day before to pick out a new dress for the festival, and she had laid it out on my bed for me, perhaps worried I might pick something else to wear at the last minute.
  
  8 With a thumping heart, I carefully slipped the dress over my head and shimmied it down, tugging at the bottom with my toes. It took me a few minutes to get it all straightened and smoothed out. I stood up and looked at myself in the mirror over my dresser. . . . 
  
  9 I gazed at myself in the mirror, wondering if I was really going to go out in front of other people looking like this. . . . 
  
  10 The sky looked like cotton candy as I made my way downstairs. I loved all the sounds and smells of the festival—corn dogs and kettle corn and chili and funnel cakes. Walking over to the Flap-Jackeroos, I ran into Jessica and a large group of girls from soccer. . . . 
  
  11 As they walked behind me, I spotted Zion sitting at a table by himself, munching on a box of popcorn. I walked with the girls over to him and introduced them. He mumbled a hello to the girls as he stared at his feet and tried to hide his popcorn behind his back. 
  
  12 I made my way to the stage and stood at the bottom of the steps. When the lead singer of the Flap-Jackeroos saw me, he told the audience they had a special accompaniment, and I walked up the stairs to join them. He placed my guitar in front of a chair on the stage for me, and I sat down. 
  
  13 But it wasn't my guitar. It was the guitar we had found in the storage room hidden under the old desk. It was the guitar that had belonged to my mother. It had been cleaned, repaired, and restrung. I looked out into the audience and saw my parents watching me. Mom put her fingers to her mouth and blew me a kiss. I slipped my feet out of my flowery flats and carefully plucked at a string with one not quite steady toe. 
  
  14 We played ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"" which I had been feverishly practicing all week, even though my part was quite simple. A large audience formed to watch as we played, and I saw that all their eyes were on me—me in my strappy pink dress. Me in my mother's necklace, playing my mother's guitar. Me with terribly flushed cheeks, beaming as the lead singer winked at me while we played. I looked out into the crowd and saw Jessica and the other girls watching me with excited faces. I saw Zion smiling and waving and I nodded back. I saw my parents, arms around each other, swaying to the music. . . .
  
  15 As the fireworks exploded over the lights of the city—millions of lights for millions of people—I didn't feel so insignificant anymore. I felt as big as the giant saguaro^2 beside me. I felt like I was shining, and this time I thought maybe it wasn't just the moon. Maybe the light was in me. ""","*Read this story. Then answer questions 1 through 7.*

2022-released-items-ela-g6,2,""" *From Nature Boy to Batman*
  
  1 Merlin Tuttle can't remember a time when nature didn't fascinate him. Even as a little kid he collected seashells, brought home toads, and kept a journal of his wildlife observations. ""I happened to get especially interested in bats beginning when I was about nine,"" says Merlin. He came across some bats living in an old cabin. That started him researching and reading about bats. When Merlin was a teenager, his family moved to Tennessee. Their new home just happened to be near a bat cave. ""I caught some and identified them in a book,"" remembers Merlin. They were gray bats. The book said that this was a species that lived in the same cave year round and didn't migrate."" After a year of watching when the bats entered and exited the cave, Merlin figured out that the books were wrong. These gray bats weren't there all year—they migrated. 
  
  2 Armed with what he'd learned, high school kid Merlin Tuttle convinced scientists at the Smithsonian Institution that they might be wrong. ""They gave me several thousand bat bands and said, ‘Why don't you go back and band them and see if you can figure out where they go,' "" remembers Merlin. Bat bands are small metal clips with identification numbers on them. The bands fit around a bat's winged arm like a bracelet. Merlin Tuttle ended up studying gray bats for many years. He visited their caves all across the southeastern United States through college and after he became a bat scientist. ""I eventually banded over forty thousand bats and traced some of the migrants all the way from Florida to the Virginia border,"" said Merlin. Because of his research, books had to be rewritten to say that gray bats not only migrate, but also often travel a really long way. 
  
  *From Scientist to Conservationist*
  
  3 Merlin kept studying bats and other animals through college. He eventually got an advanced degree in mammalogy, the study of mammals, the kind of animals bats are. While Merlin became a respected bat scientist in the 1970s, bats themselves got very little respect. Merlin traveled around the world studying bats—Africa, Asia, Latin America, and North America. ""Everywhere I went, people were killing bats in large numbers just out of ignorance,"" says Merlin. Many people are afraid of bats. Bats live in dark spooky places like caves and abandoned buildings, and only come out at night. Merlin saw bat caves dynamited or bulldozed shut. Misguided farmers told him they killed bats to protect their fruit trees or crops. Even the caves where Merlin studied gray bats were under attack. In 1976 Merlin visited an Alabama cave that was once home to 250,000 gray bats. What he found shocked him. All the bats were gone. Inside the cave were sticks, stones, rifle cartridges, and fireworks wrappers. 
  
  4 Merlin Tuttle decided he had to do something to help the bats he loved to study, so he started an organization in 1982. It wasn't easy. ""When I started Bat Conservation International (BCI), most people would've rather paid to kill a bat than to save one,"" says Merlin. ""They ranked between cockroaches and rattlesnakes in opinion polls."" People misunderstand bats. They mistakenly believe that bats are blind, fierce, diseasecarrying, scary critters that want to bite. So Merlin set out to educate people about how gentle, amazing, and important bats really are.
  
  5 Photography quickly became an important tool. ""People fear most what they understand least,"" explains Merlin. Bats are misunderstood partly because they are hard to see. Bats fly at night and spend the day in dark places. When Merlin started writing books about bats, most photographs showed bats with snarling teeth held up by their wings. Merlin knew the bats in the photographs looked frightening because they were scared and stressed. So he started taking his own photographs of bats at ease—bats just being bats. His stunning natural photos soon showed up in magazines and books. The photos of bats flying, eating nectar, catching fish, and caring for pups helped people see bats for what they really are—and want to save them.""",*Read this article.

2022-released-items-ela-g6,3,"""1 It looked like a blue leather wallet, only bigger. Milo climbed down onto the rails behind the car and picked it up. 
  
  2 And that's how he found the first map. 
  
  3 It was tucked into the left-hand pocket of the leather wallet, folded into quarters. paper was old and green-tinged, the way the copper pots in the inn's kitchen were tinted green from verdigris—only Milo had never seen paper turn green like that. He unfolded it carefully with cold fingers. It was brittle and delicate and didn't look as if it could stand much more folding and unfolding, but he could tell it had once been thick and expensive. Milo held it up so that the light from the closest lamp post shone through, and he could just make out a watermark:^1 it looked like a wrought-iron gate, but slightly warped and wrenched out of its original shape. 
  
  4 It was then, with the page lit up from behind, that Milo realized what he was looking at. He turned and hopped across the rails to the shed that housed the big winch, turned on the overhead light, and held the paper up again to get a better look. . . . 
  
  5 Milo knew a thing or two about maps. This, of course, came from twelve years of growing up around smugglers and sailors. And as he stared at the paper in his hands, he realized it reminded him of a very specific sort of map, one that he saw fairly often. It looked like a nautical chart, the kind that ships' navigators use. 
  
  6 Yes, a nautical chart. That was exactly what it was, with the shadings of blue and the green dots meant to represent the different depths of the waterway. The bird shape must be the compass rose, which would mean the wing with the arrow was supposed to be pointing north. 
  
  7 He turned the page so that the arrow pointed up, but that didn't make the waterway any more familiar. He turned it again and again, trying to find the orientation that would transform it into something recognizable: the Skidwrack River, or the Magothy Bay it emptied into, or one of the Skidwrack's inland tributaries. But no matter which way he held the map, it didn't look like any river or bay Milo knew of.
  
  8 Then, outside in the pavilion, he heard a voice muttering curses. He put his eye to the crack between the door and its frame. A person wrapped in a heavy coat crossed Milo's view, head hunched low into the collar. A short, sharp breeze kicked up, swirling snow around the figure. It wasn't his mother or father, but between the snow and the twinkling lights, he couldn't quite work out which of the guests it was. 
  
  9 The person strode out of view and back in again, making a circuit of the pavilion, then hopped down onto the tracks inside it. Milo heard footsteps crunching over the stones between the steel rails. 
  
  10 He or she had to be looking for the leather wallet Milo had just found. The logical thing to do would be to step out and announce that he'd found it. It was, after all, the property of one of the guests, and at some point, he was going to have to give it back. Still, when the dark shadow swung itself back up off the tracks, something made Milo edge deeper into the shed and tuck himself as far behind the winch as he could. 
  
  11 He held his breath and waited. Long minutes passed without any sound from outside. As quietly as he could, he refolded the map and tucked it inside the leather wallet. He slipped it into his other back pocket, making certain it was hidden by his coat. Then, when he was sure, absolutely sure, that he was alone in the pavilion again, he crept out of the shed. Whoever it had been, he or she had left footprints, but already the swirling snow was busy erasing them. ""","*Read this story. Then answer questions 22 through 28.*

2022-released-items-ela-g7,1,"""1. During those first two weeks after Luther stopped being his friend, Chip dreaded going to school. The only hour of his day that was bearable was science class. Chip used to think of science as a bunch of boring words in a textbook, but Mr. O'Dell had changed all that. And kind of by accident, Chip had become one of Mr. O'Dell's favorite students.
  
  2. It started when Mr. O'Dell announced how students could get a good grade in his class—not by memorizing a lot of facts but by _thinking._ The students stared at him, either wondering what he was talking about or else marveling at the fringe of reddish-brown hair surrounding his shiny bald head...
  
  3. Mr. O'Dell had answered by asking another question. ""What common substance can take the form of a liquid, a solid, or a gas?""
  
  4. Nobody answered. The class just sat there, waiting for Mr. O'Dell to explain what that had to do with anything. Then Chip got it. Mr. O'Dell meant that he was likely to throw out questions about things that weren't in the book and expect students to figure out the answers for themselves. To Chip, the question seemed more like a riddle.
  
  5. The first liquid Chip thought of was water, and then he thought of ice. Ice is a solid. And when water gets super hot, it turns to steam. He wasn't sure if steam was a gas or not, but when nobody else spoke, Chip blurted out, ""Water?""
  
  6. After that, Chip could tell that Mr. O'Dell liked him. Chip liked him too—at least most of the time. In English, social studies, and math, Mr. O'Dell was just an average teacher. But the minute the lesson turned to science, Mr. O'Dell practically exploded with energy and enthusiasm.
  
  7. The best part about science class was the field trips. The principal usually allowed outdoor field trips only once or twice a semester, but Mr. O'Dell had special permission to take his class once a month to a big vacant lot down the street to study biology ""in the field."" Kate had told Chip that Mr. O'Dell had once taught in college and had written a book on field biology. She figured that was the reason he got special privileges.
  
  8. Chip quickly discovered that what Mr. O'Dell called field biology was what he had been doing all his life: paying attention to other living things. Chip had favorites—ducks and turtles, for example, and lightning bugs. But Mr. O'Dell seemed to be interested in every living creature. Once when a student pointed out an anthill, Mr. O'Dell put his nose down so close to watch that Chip expected an ant to climb right onto it and march up through the freckles to stare back at him through his gold-rimmed glasses. Another time, Mr. O'Dell had the whole class sit cross-legged in a circle to watch a chameleon change from brown to bright green. While they waited still and quiet, they got to see it let down a flap of bright red skin under its chin to attract insects. Anyone who wasn't paying close attention missed the important moment when the lizard flicked out its long tongue and whisked a fly back into its mouth.
  
  9. Mr. O'Dell had the students take detailed notes on each animal or insect they were observing. He also encouraged them to make sketches of what they saw. The trips with Mr. O'Dell had taught Chip a different way of looking at things.
  
  10. Out where Chip lived there wasn't a lot of wildlife in the plowed fields, which were heavily pesticided. But quite a few interesting creatures still lived in the drainage ditches and the high grass along the banks. When Luther first came to live with his grandparents, Chip had showed him where to find the birds' nests built so low to the ground that you could look right in and watch the eggs hatch. He'd also taught Luther—a boy raised in New York City who knew nothing about Florida wildlife—how to tell the difference between slow land turtles and snapping turtles. For one thing, if you didn't catch a snapping turtle just right, it could give you a bite that really hurt...
  
  11. Mr. O'Dell never talked about an animal's feelings, but about its purpose, and why it ought to be right where it was, doing whatever it was doing. Like the day after Luther got mad at Chip, when Chip brought a blue skink^1 to class. Mr. O'Dell was as excited as if it was a baby dinosaur. In about five minutes he had everybody in the class involved in trying to find out more about skinks. But when the class ended, he'd called Chip up to his desk and said, ""Now, you'll take this skink back and put it right where you found it, won't you?""...
  
  12. Mr. O'Dell looked at the skink, then at Chip. ""If somebody put you in a car and drove you far away and dumped you out, would that be okay with you?""
  
  13. ""Probably not,"" Chip admitted. ""I'd want to go home.""
  
  14. ""Most critters do,"" Mr. O'Dell pointed out. ""Things do happen that displace us from our homes. Humans are pretty good at adapting to new locations, but even for them, it's stressful. And some creatures can't manage it at all. If you take them out of their natural environment, they just die.""...

2022-released-items-ela-g7,2,"""1. The Iditarod is one of the toughest races in the world, and it takes place over some of the most challenging landscapes on the planet. It is a race by dogsled that follows a route over a thousand miles long through the wilderness of Alaska. No woman has triumphed more consistently over this relentless challenge than Susan Butcher.
  
  2. Born in Massachusetts in 1954, Butcher was drawn as a child to the wilderness and to the animals that filled it. Her parents were interested in boats and sailing, but Butcher seems to have been born with a passion for the outdoors not shared with family members. When she was eight, she wrote a two-sentence essay that read: ""I hate the city. I love the country.""
  
  3. Two pet Siberian huskies kindled her interest in dogsled racing. Butcher had always known she would spend her life working in some way with animals. When she decided to move to Colorado at age 17 to become a professional dog musher, or driver, her parents were less than pleased. They would have preferred their daughter go to college. But Butcher had always been a child who knew what she wanted to do and did it. She moved with her two huskies to Colorado in 1972. In her spare time, she studied veterinary medicine at a nearby university, focusing on the care of dogs. In 1973, she heard about the first Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race being organized in Alaska. Everything about Alaska, especially the pioneer-style living its wilderness offered, appealed to Butcher. In 1975, she found work at the University of Alaska and moved to Fairbanks. At the same time, she began to put together a team of dogs to enter in the Iditarod.
  
  4. Training for the Iditarod encompasses a wide scope of activities. To begin with, both the musher of the dogsled and the entire team of dogs must be in top physical condition. Both Susan and her dogs trained up to 16 hours a day, seven days a week. They had to develop the physical stamina they would need to endure over two weeks of peak performance under challenging and sometimes dangerous conditions. Training to work with each other is also a crucial part of preparation for the Iditarod.
  
  5. The musher must have faith in each and every dog on her team, and most importantly, she must have a lead dog whom she can trust with her life. A lead dog must be able to assert himself over the other dogs and make snap judgments on the trail if an obstacle suddenly looms into view. And a lead dog must be able to make decisions even if they go against what the musher is commanding. One of Butcher's lead dogs refused to turn left on a river path early on in the training. It was only after the dog pulled Butcher and the team in the opposite direction that the reason became clear. The portion of the trail to the left was a flimsy snow bridge that would have collapsed under the weight of the team, sending dogs, sled, and musher into the river. The lead dog's instinct had been absolutely correct. To cultivate and recognize this instinct, Butcher bonded with her dogs and treated them as friends, family, and professional athletes. In her earliest years training for the Iditarod, Butcher explains that living in the wilderness to train, the dogs were not just friends to her, they were her only friends at all.
  
  6. By the time Butcher was ready to enter her first Iditarod in 1978, the race was still largely the domain of men. Only three women had previously completed the course. Butcher was not welcomed with open arms, but she chose to ignore the resistance from the male mushers. She finished the race in 19th place, which was an extremely respectable showing for a newcomer, man or woman, and made her the first woman to place in the top 20.
  
  7. Butcher ran the Iditarod every year after that, and by 1984 she had placed second in two races. She now felt she was good enough to win the Iditarod outright, but in 1985 her dreams were cut violently short. Early on in the race, she and her team came upon a pregnant and hungry moose, which charged the dogs, attacking them with its massive hooves. Two of Butcher's dogs were killed, and many others were badly hurt. Butcher chose to withdraw from the race to tend to her dogs' injuries, leaving another woman, Libby Riddles, to become the first woman to win the Iditarod.
  
  8. In 1986, it was Butcher's turn. Though two of her dogs fell through the ice while they were leading the sled over a river, Butcher was able to pull the dogs to safety and continue the race. Sleeping only a few hours each night, she overtook other teams one at a time until she had taken the lead. Eleven days after starting, Butcher and her team crossed the finish line in first place. She had not only won the race, she had also set a new speed record. Nine years after running her first Iditarod as a ""rookie,"" Susan Butcher had now earned the respect and admiration of almost every other musher, male and female alike.""",*Read this article.

2022-released-items-ela-g7,3,"""1 If you were in the school band, you might play the trumpet, the violin, or the flute, but how about the marimba, the oud, or the zurna? Although these may sound like ingredients in an exotic recipe, they are actually musical instruments—some of them hundreds of years old. Many of the instruments we know and play today, like the piano, the guitar, and the oboe, evolved from these older instruments. The instruments came to America with people who emigrated from countries all around the world, bringing music, and a little bit of their culture, with them. 
  
  *Percussion Instruments*
  
  2 As you can see from the picture, the xylophone is played with a padded mallet (which looks like a hammer).. . .
  
  3 Playing the xylophone well requires great precision to hit just the right bar at the right time, which produces a musical tone. The xylophone is a percussion instrument (one that is played either by striking, shaking or scraping it) that likely originated in Southeast Asia or Oceania. It's one of the central instruments of the music of Africa, possibly being brought to that continent through trade or people migrating from other places. Slaves from Africa brought the xylophone with them when they were taken to Latin America, and from there it eventually made its way to the United States. Today's xylophone has bars arranged in two rows, sort of like the keys of a piano, and rests on a stand. . .
  
  4 The marimba is another percussion instrument that is played with a rubber mallet. Marimba is the African name for xylophone. It resembles that instrument in shape, but it's bigger and has a wider range of notes___The fact that marimba songs were well liked by Americans shows the increased exposure the public had to foreign styles of music. 
  
  5 The hammered dulcimer, in its simplest form, is an instrument with 13 strings, played by beating the strings with a small hammer. The name ""dulcimer"" comes from Latin and means ""sweet sound."" The hammered dulcimer developed from the cimbalom, an instrument from Hungary with 48 strings that is played with small hammers. The piano of today has evolved from both the cimbalom and the hammered dulcimer. Have you ever seen the inside of a piano? When someone presses a piano key, a lever raises a hammer that then strikes the string producing a musical note. How do you suppose this came about? 
  
  *Stringed Instruments*
  
  6 Rock and roll music, as we know it, wouldn't exist without the guitar, but would it have existed without the oud? The oud is an Arabic instrument that, as you can see from the picture, looks a lot like a round guitar. The oud was brought to Spain and eventually turned into the lute. The lute is the instrument that evolved into the guitar. Today the oud is still played in Arab countries.. . .
  
  7 Around 1915, Hawaiian performers on vaudeville^1 and in other shows made Hawaiian-style songs very popular. Hawaiian music was played with a Hawaiian guitar, an instrument with a long sounding board and six to eight steel strings. The instrument is played by touching the strings with a steel bar or some hard object. Although it's not clear who invented the steel guitar style, legend has it that the first person to develop this technique was Hawaiian schoolboy Joseph Kekuku. He discovered the sound while walking along a railroad track strumming his guitar with a metal bolt that he found along the tracks.
  
  8 In country and bluegrass music, the band plays stringed instruments like the guitar, banjo, fiddle, stand-up bass, and mandolin, but did you know that years ago, a band might play these same instruments made out of gourds? Gourds are hard-shelled, round-shaped fruits. During the Great Depression, people couldn't afford store-bought instruments so they made their own. . . . 
  
  *Wind Instruments*
  
  9 Just like percussion and strings, most wind instruments evolved from much older folk instruments. The misnice is a bagpipe-like instrument made out of the skin of a goat. In Europe, references to the misnice are found as early as the ninth century. The misnice was found in North Africa and in somewhat different forms in Eastern Europe (Serbia, Hungary, Ukraine, and elsewhere). . . . 
  
  10 The zurna, also known as the surna, is an instrument from Islamic areas including Iran, Mesopotamia, and Syria. The popularity of the zurna quickly spread through areas conquered by the Arabs. The Arabs first used it in military bands, and later used it to greet important persons, mark the beginnings of pilgrimages, and in other important ceremonies. Today the zurna still exists as a folk instrument used mainly in festive village music in Islamic areas, as well as Greece, Cyprus, and Armenia. The modern day version of the zurna is the oboe, which is a staple of any symphony orchestra. 
  
  11 If you don't have any instruments at all, and you can't make one, you can always whistle. Whistling is a way to use your vocal cords as a musical instrument. Just put your lips together and blow, and you can take that song with you anywhere you go.""",*Read this article. Then answer questions 29 through 35.*,"*Uncommon Instruments*

2022-released-items-ela-g8,1,"""1 Soon after breakfast, mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam to the ground, and rolled the canvas part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from the newly burnt prairie.
  
  2 Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.
  
  3 Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after every stitch. . . .
  
  4 Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light, sharpened rod about four feet long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature's rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird's egg. Soon satiated^1 with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots
  
  5 I remember well how we used to exchange our necklaces, beaded belts, and sometimes even our moccasins. We pretended to offer them as gifts to one another. We delighted in impersonating our own mothers. We talked of things we had heard them say in their conversations. We imitated their various manners, even to the inflection of their voices. In the lap of the prairie, we seated ourselves upon our feet, and leaning our painted cheeks in the palms of our hands, we rested our elbows on our knees, and bent forward as old women were most accustomed to do.
  
  6 While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones ""Han! han!"" (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath, or sometimes for our sympathy. As the discourse became more thrilling, according to our ideas, we raised our voices in these interjections. In these impersonations, our parents were led to say only those things that were in common favor.
  
  7 No matter how exciting a tale we might be rehearsing, the mere shifting of a cloud shadow in the landscape near by was sufficient to change our impulses; and soon we were all chasing the great shadows that played among the hills. We shouted and whooped in the chase; laughing and calling to one another, we were like little sportive nymphs^2 on that Dakota sea of rolling green.
  
  8 On one occasion I forgot the cloud shadow in a strange notion to catch up with my own shadow. Standing straight and still, I began to glide after it, putting out one foot cautiously. When, with the greatest care, I set my foot in advance of myself, my shadow crept onward too. Then again I tried it; this time with the other foot. Still again my shadow escaped me. I began to run; and away flew my shadow, always just a step beyond me. Faster and faster I ran, setting my teeth and clenching my fists, determined to overtake my own fleet shadow. But ever swifter it glided before me while I was growing breathless and hot. Slackening my speed, I was greatly vexed that my shadow should check its pace also. Daring it to the utmost, as I thought, I sat down upon a rock imbedded in the hillside.
  
  9 So! my shadow had the impudence^3 to sit down beside me!
  
  10 Now my comrades caught up with me, and began to ask why I was running away so fast.
  
  11 ""Oh, I was chasing my shadow! Didn't you ever do that?"" I inquired, surprised that they should not understand.
  
  12 They planted their moccasined feet firmly upon my shadow to stay it, and I arose. Again my shadow slipped away, and moved as often as I did. Then we gave up trying to catch my shadow.
  
  13 Before this peculiar experience, I have no distinct memory of having recognized any vital bond between myself and my shadow. I never gave it an afterthought.
  
  14 Returning to our borrowed belts and trinkets, we rambled homeward. At evening, as on other evenings, I went to sleep over my legends.""",*Directions Read this passage. Then answer questions 8 through 14.*,"*Excerpt from* *""The Beadwork""* *from  American Indian Stories*

2022-released-items-ela-g8,2,"1 The cat's name was Chibi, which means ""little one."" We could hear the boy's particularly high-pitched voice calling the cat: ""Chibi!"" Then we'd hear the sound of the boy's shoes running around outside, followed by the tinkling of the little bell announcing the cat's arrival.
  
  2 Chibi was a jewel of a cat. Her pure white fur was mottled with several lampblack blotches containing just a bit of light brown. The sort of cat you might see just about anywhere in Japan, except she was especially slim and tiny.
  
  3 These were her individual characteristics—slim and small, with ears that stood out, tapering off beautifully at the tips, and often twitching. She would approach silently and undetected to rub up against one's legs. At first, I thought Chibi avoided me because I was not used to cats, but this seems not to have been the case. When a girl who often passed along Lightning Alley stopped and crouched to gaze at the cat, it did not run away. But as soon as she attempted to touch it, the cat quickly slipped off, avoiding contact at all costs. The cat's manner of rejection was like cold, white light.
  
  4 Moreover, the cat rarely made a sound. As far as I remember, when it first appeared in the alley it made some sort of sound, but since then it had never let out a meow. It looked as if no matter how much time passed the cat was not going to let us hear its voice. This seemed to be the message the cat was giving us.
  
  5 Another one of Chibi's characteristics was that she changed the direction of her cautious attention frequently. This active behavior wasn't limited to her kittenhood. Perhaps because she played alone most of the time in the expansive garden, she reacted strongly to insects and reptiles. And there were times when I could only conclude that she must be reacting to subtle changes in the wind and light, not detectable by humans. It may be that most cats share the same quickness, but even so, in Chibi's case, it was acute—she was, after all, the cat of Lightning Alley. My wife got into the habit of pointing to the cat whenever it went by, extolling^1 its virtues. . . .
  
  6 Chibi, who loved to play ball, gradually began to visit us on her own and would try and get us to play with her. She would step gingerly into the room and gaze intently at its occupants, then purposefully turn around and walk back out, as if to lead us to the garden. This process would be repeated until she got a response. Most of the time my wife would put down whatever she was doing, slip happily into her sandals and head outside.
  
  7 Having played to her heart's content, Chibi would come inside and rest for a while. When she began to sleep on the sofa—like a talisman^2 curled gently in the shape of a comma and dug up from a prehistoric archaeological site—a deep sense of happiness arrived, as if the house itself had dreamed this scene.
  
  8 Avoiding the prying eyes of the landlady, we began leaving it up to Chibi to come inside the house whenever she wanted—and with this new development I had begun little by little to understand cat lovers. Whether on TV or in all of the ubiquitous^3 cat calendars, it seemed as if there was no cat comparable to her. But, though I had started to think of her as the best cat around, she was not really our cat.
  
  9 First we would hear the tinkling of the bell, and then she would appear, so we began to call her by the nickname ""Tinkerbell."" Whenever we wanted her to come over, this name seemed to find itself on our lips.
  
  10 ""I wonder where Tinkerbell is."" By the time my wife had gotten the words out of her mouth we'd hear the tinkling of Chibi's bell. We'd realize that she was near at the point where, exiting the foyer next door (located at the second corner of Lightning Alley), Chibi would leap through the tear in the wire-mesh boundary of the property, dash along the side of the building, turn at the far end of the veranda, leap up onto the open area of the deck, and then, placing her front paws on the window frame at about the height of a human adult's knee, stretch out her neck to peek inside.
  
  11 In winter she came inside. Little by little, through the crack in the partially opened window, her tendency to visit subtly developed; her appearances were repeated until, as if a silken opening in a fabric had been continuously moistened and stretched, Chibi had entered our lives. But at the same time—call it fate if you will—something else was closing in and pressing itself against that tendency.

2022-released-items-ela-g8,3,"1 Salty ocean smells mingle with the aromas of sweet cotton candy and Nathan's Famous hot dogs. The legendary Cyclone roller coaster lurches along its tracks—then takes a heart-stopping plunge. Riders whoop and scream with excitement. Farther down the boardwalk, the sound of a carousel starts. Patrons pitch balls at moving targets, hoping to win a prize. Welcome to Coney Island, the nation's first truly modern amusement area.
  
  2 Located on the southern tip of Brooklyn, New York, Coney Island has been the place to go for fun for more than a century. The inspiration for amusement parks such as Coney Island sprang from an exciting event in 1893—the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It was one of the first venues where people experienced a variety of attractions in one large space.
  
  3 Visitors to Chicago gasped in wonder when they saw the fair's ""White City"" spread out before them. Beautiful all-white exhibition buildings and large classical statues framed a lagoon of shimmering water. Designed to educate and inform, about a dozen grand buildings housed displays on the latest developments in transportation, machinery, agriculture, art, horticulture, and more. Most visitors had never seen the things they saw there, such as electric lights, a moving sidewalk, world-famous artwork, and moving pictures.
  
  4 While the World's Columbian Exposition awed people with new innovations and ideas, its most popular attraction was the Midway Plaisance. Located in a separate section of the exhibition grounds, the Midway was filled with entertainment: rides, food stands, and sideshows. People could get a taste of international cultures, for example, by riding a camel through the Streets of Cairo or strolling among the thatched huts of a South Sea village. Best of all, they could ride George Ferris's giant spinning wheel. Rising 264 feet above the Midway, this engineering marvel became the star of the fair. It was a spectacular example of what the new age of machines made possible.
  
  5 One visitor, New York showman George C. Tilyou, immediately saw potential for this new form of entertainment. Tilyou owned property on Coney Island, which already was an established beach resort with hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants. It also featured an odd collection of sideshows, food vendors, fortunetellers, and more. Tilyou decided to build an enclosed amusement park there.
  
  6 In 1897, Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park. When he was unable to buy Ferris's wheel, he had his own version built. For 25 cents, visitors could ride Tilyou's wheel, enjoy the Scenic Railway, or climb into a ""spaceship"" for a Trip to the Moon. On the Steeplechase, wooden horses carried riders along a metal racetrack from a starting gate to a finish line.
  
  7 Steeplechase Park's huge success was partly due to another invention—electric railways. The first electric trolley line had connected Manhattan Island and Coney Island in the mid-1800s. By the turn of the 20th century, an electric train offered an even faster way to carry more people wanting to escape from the hot, crowded city.
  
  8 In the late 1800s and early 1900s, most people worked long hours and six days a week in urban factories and shops. But for a nickel fare, a city worker could afford a day's outing to a nearby park on Sundays. Recognizing the value of giving the working class access to day trips, trolley and train companies established parks that were located at the end of a line. Travelers disembarked to enjoy simple outdoor pleasures in picnic groves and swimming pools or beaches. Eventually, merry-go-rounds, penny arcades^1, and even small roller coasters were added. . .
  
  9 Part sideshow, part circus, part theme park, Coney Island set an example for amusement parks. Attractions that are so familiar today—roller coasters, water rides, fun houses, Tunnels of Love—all got their start there.
  
  10 Many amusement parks closed during the Great Depression in the 1930s or during World War II (1939-1945). Coney Island has had its ups and downs, too. Over the decades, fires and age destroyed some of the original attractions. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy wrecked the boardwalk and many of the attractions.
  
  11 In spite of all that, Coney Island has survived, and it is still operating today. It continues to offer each new generation of kids (and their parents) a chance to escape to a special world of entertainment and thrills. And from New Jersey's Wildwood Park to California's Pacific Park and Florida's Walt Disney World, other amusement and theme parks have taken their cues from Coney Island. They have grown to epic proportions in their efforts to offer a world full of fun.

2023-released-items-ela-g3,1,"1 ""It's time to see how much you've grown since last year,"" Mom answered.
  
  2 How could Trent and I have forgotten? Every year on our birthday Mom has us stand up straight against the bedroom doorjamb and she makes a mark to indicate how much we'd grown since the year before. My marks are in blue pencil crayon. Trent's are in red.
  
  3 ""Do I have to right now, Mom?"" Trent pleaded. ""I want to get this aquarium ready for my new discus fish."" . . . 
  
  4 ""Come on now, it won't take long,"" Mom persisted. She held out a red pencil crayon and directed Trent to the door. ""Head and shoulders straight, back against the doorjamb. Let's go!""
  
  5 In a hurry to get this over with, Trent trotted to the doorway and stood up against the jamb. He waited as Mom made sure he wasn't slouching or stretching and carefully marked the spot on the jamb where the top of his head reached.
  
  6 ""Done?"" Trent asked.
  
  7 Mom ignored him. ""Isn't that interesting,"" she said.
  
  8 ""What?"" Dad inquired.
  
  9 ""Yeah, what?"" Trent echoed. 
  
  10 ""Well,"" Mom smiled, ""your mark is higher than Troy's last mark. That's the first time that's ever happened.""
  
  11 ""No way,"" Trent squealed with delight.
  
  12 ""Take a look for yourself,"" Mom instructed.
  
  13 I rushed over to the doorway and actually nudged Trent out of the way to get a better look. I couldn't believe my eyes. The red mark was indeed a little higher than the blue.
  
  14 ""I'm taller than Troy!"" Trent celebrated. ""Awesome!""
  
  15 ""You must have made a mistake,"" I protested to Mom. I could feel my stomach churning.
  
  16 ""No, honey. I'm really careful with this."" Mom looked me in the eyes, patted my shoulder. ""Anyhow, there's very little difference."" . . . 
  
  17 ""Why don't the two of you stand back to back?"" Dad suggested. ""Then you'll see exactly who's taller."" Now Dad was really thinking.
  
  18 ""Sure,"" I volunteered. I wanted to lay this matter to rest as soon as possible.
  
  19 ""Sounds good to me,"" Trent echoed. 
  
  20 Trent and I turned and stepped backwards towards each other. We jostled a few seconds, adjusting ourselves to the tallest possible posture. His bony shoulder blades dug into my back. His long hair tickled my neck.
  
  21 ""Well, what do you say?"" I asked.
  
  22 ""Hold on,"" Dad answered. He had moved in close and was making sure neither of us were standing on our tiptoes or stretching our necks. His hands rested on each of our heads, keeping us in place. Meanwhile, Mom tilted her head to inspect us closely.
  
  23 ""Well?"" I asked again.
  
  24 Mom emitted a nervous little cough. ""I could be wrong, but . . ."" 
  
  25 ""But what?"" I prodded.
  
  26 ""I think Trent is just a smidgen taller."" She coughed again. ""Of course, that could be because he has more hair.""
  
  27 Trent hurriedly lifted his hand to his head and patted down his hair. ""How about now?"" he asked.
  
  28 ""Um . . ."" Mom stalled.
  
  29 ""Dad?"" I pleaded. Standing tall, I kept my head forward and my back straight. I trusted his judgment. 
  
  30 ""Well, Troy, you may not like to hear this, but as far as I can tell Trent is in fact taller. Not by much, that's for sure, but there is a difference. Nine-tenths of a centimeter, I'd say."" 
  
  31 ""Nine-tenths of a centimeter?"" I repeated.
  
  32 ""Yes!"" Trent celebrated.
  
  33 ""I can't believe this,"" I whined. ""There's just no way."" My mind raced. Something had to be wrong about this. Even Dad could make mistakes sometimes. ""Bring me a mirror,"" I demanded.
  
  34 ""A mirror?"" Mom gasped.
  
  35 ""Don't be ridiculous,"" Dad scoffed.
  
  36 ""Just bring me a mirror, please,"" I begged. ""Please!""
  
  37 Mom shuffled off to her and Dad's room and came back with her make-up mirror, round-faced with a long handle, almost like the kind you see in old fairytale picture books. I grabbed it roughly and held it out to the side. Immediately Trent and I both turned our heads to see the evidence. It was tough to make out the difference between us, but there it was, reflected back at me, as undeniable as the pain that was settling right now into the pit of my stomach.

  2 She wears them around the house. She wears them around the town. She wears them made out of cotton. She wears them made out of silk.
  
  3 Sometimes she tucks the pallu, the end of her sari, tightly. And sometimes she lets it dance in the breeze. 
  
  4 ""Your saris are beautiful, Dadima,"" I say one day. ""But don't you get tired of wearing them?""
  
  5 ""Never, Rupa,"" Dadima says. . . .
  
  6 ""Why not?"" I want to know.
  
  7 ""Because a sari is a sari and I can do so much with it,"" she says.
  
  8 ""What can you do with a sari?"" I ask.
  
  9 ""Suppose you and I are sitting out on the porch and it gets hot,"" Dadima says. ""Then we can keep cool."" She begins to fan the two of us with the end of her sari.
  
  10 ""Oh,"" I say. ""That's nice.""
  
  11 ""If we go to the beach and collect seashells, we can wrap the shells in my sari,"" Dadima says.
  
  12 ""Like this?"" I ask. I make a pouch with the end of her sari.
  
  13 ""Yes,"" Dadima answers.
  
  14 ""What else?"" I ask.
  
  15 ""Suppose we go for a walk and it begins to sprinkle,"" Dadima says. ""I can make an umbrella."" And right then she covers both our heads with her sari. 
  
  16 I like the feel of it, light and cool as a breeze. . . . 
  
  17 Just then my little sister Neha comes to find me. ""Rupa, Rupa, where are you?"" she calls.
  
  18 I decide to play a game with Neha. Quickly, I cover myself with Dadima's sari. While I am hiding under there, I make a secret knot in the corner of her pallu. That way Dadima will remember to give me a hug.
  
  19 ""I found you, Rupa!"" Neha says. ""My turn to hide.""
  
  20 I come out and Neha hides under the pallu.
  
  21 ""Dadima, did your dadima wear a sari too?"" I ask.
  
  22 ""Yes,"" Dadima answers. ""And so did my dadima's dadima.""
  
  23 Neha pokes her head out. ""When I grow up, will you make me a sari?"" she asks.
  
  24 ""You and Rupa can wear my saris,"" Dadima says. 
  
  25 ""But they won't fit,"" Neha says. She looks sad.
  
  26 ""A sari can fit anyone,"" Dadima tells her. ""Come with me.""
  
  27 We all go to Dadima's room.
  
  28 Dadima takes out a bright yellow sari from her closet. ""Unfold this,"" she says.
  
  29 Neha and I unfold and unfold and unfold some more.
  
  30 ""But this is just a lot of cloth,"" I say, shaking my head.
  
  31 ""That's right,"" Dadima says. ""A sari is a long piece of material that you wrap around yourself in a special way."" . . . 
  
  32 Dadima takes out many saris. . . . 
  
  33 ""Which one is your favorite, Dadima?"" I ask.
  
  34 ""I like all of them,"" Dadima says. ""But I have three special saris.""
  
  35 Dadima takes out a pale yellow sari with rainbow-colored polka dots. ""This one is a half-sari. It is special because it was my first sari,"" she tells us.
  
  36 Next she picks up a pink sari as soft as Neha's cheeks. ""I wore this sari on the plane when I came from India to America,"" she says.
  
  37 Then Dadima shows Neha and me a sari that shimmers. It is red with a pallu stitched in gold.
  
  38 ""This is my wedding sari,"" she whispers. . . . 
  
  39 Dadima puts the sari with polka dots on Neha and the soft pink one on me. . . . 
  
  40 Dressed in our saris, all three of us stand in front of the mirror.
  
  41 Dadima draws her sari over her head, making a snug frame around her face. Neha and I do the same. Our eyes twinkle in the mirror like the golden threads in Dadima's wedding pallu.
  
  42 ""We look like you, Dadima,"" I say.
  
  43 ""Yes,"" she says, taking Neha and me in her arms. ""Very much so.""

  3 Things get interesting after a lightning bolt brightens the darkening sky like a camera flash, followed by a loud crash of thunder. Billy flies off the couch and runs to his room.
  
  4 The Clarksons gave me emergency numbers and other instructions, but they didn't tell me what to do if their kid decides to hide under his bed.
  
  5 ""What's wrong, Billy?"" I ask as if I don't already know. . . . 
  
  6 Silence for a moment, then the truth. ""I'm afraid of thunderstorms,"" he says.
  
  7 Part of being a great baby-sitter is being an expert in a lot of fields—a nurse for bandaging banged-up knees, a chef for concocting interesting snacks, and a writer for coming up with good bedtime stories. This time, I need to be a psychologist.
  
  8 ""Billy, a lot of people don't like thunderstorms,"" I say.
  
  9 ""I'm not a lot of people,"" he points out.
  
  10 I don't know how to respond to that. I make a mental note to brush up on my psychology and I take a more basic approach. ""You'll miss my famous cheese-and-pepper-flavored popcorn. . . .""
  
  11 I don't want Billy to have a miserable night. What can I do? 
  
  12 I look around for inspiration and spot Billy's sports trophies and ribbons. Then it hits me. ""If you don't come out, you're going to miss the funderstorm.""
  
  13 ""You mean ‘thunderstorm,' "" he corrects.
  
  14 ""Nope. I mean _funderstorm_.""
  
  15 Billy peeks his head out. ""What's that?""
  
  16 ""It's having fun during a thunderstorm,"" I explain. ""When the lightning strikes, you see how many things you can do before the thunder comes. . . .""
  
  17 At that moment, lightning lights up the room. Billy looks at me expectantly.
  
  18 I spot a lone sock dangling from his dresser drawer. ""How many socks can you put on one foot? Go!"" 
  
  19 He runs to his dresser and starts putting on socks. His right foot grows bigger with each new one.
  
  20 I count along. ""3 . . . 4 . . . 5 . . ."" He gets to 8 before the thunder booms and rattles the windows.
  
  21 It also rattles his nerves. Before he can dive back under the bed, I yell, ""Fruits! How many can you name?""
  
  22 The sky lights up.
  
  23 ""Apple, banana, pear . . . ,"" he chants. He's in the middle of listing melons when the round ends with a sharp crack.
  
  24 ""Pretty impressive,"" I say.
  
  25 ""What else?"" he says.
  
  26 I smile. Now he's really on board. ""Let's see your hopping skills."" I peek out the window. ""Ready, set . . ."" At the flash, I yell, ""Go!""
  
  27 He starts hopping on one foot. After 10 seconds, he switches to the other foot, then back again at 20 seconds. He's at 29 hops when a softer boom signals the end of the round. 
  
  28 ""That's the best I've ever done,"" he says. 
  
  29 ""You getting hungry?"" I ask, grinning like a cheetah. ""At the next lightning bolt, go to the kitchen, grab the popcorn, and come back.""
  
  30 I can still see a little worry in his eyes. ""You OK?"" I ask. 
  
  31 ""Yes,"" he says confidently, surprising me with the speed of his answer.
  
  32 I yell, ""Go!"" exactly when the flash comes.
  
  33 He peels out of his room. Sixteen seconds later, he leaps back in, drops the container of popcorn on his dresser, and falls breathlessly onto the floor.
  
  34 ""Sixteen seconds,"" I say, looking at my watch and smiling. ""Not bad.""
  
  35 We don't hear anything for a minute or two.
  
  36 ""I think the storm is going away,"" he says.
  
  37 So is the worried look in his eyes.
  
  38 When the Clarksons return, they apologize for not calling home. They were in the theater and didn't hear the storm.
  
  39 ""How'd our boy weather the thunderstorm?"" Mrs. Clarkson asks as she gives Billy a hug. 
  
  40 ""_Funderstorm,_"" he corrects, giving me a sly look. ""And I can't wait till the next one!""
  
  41 Billy isn't kidding.
  
  42 I can't take other baby-sitting jobs if storm clouds start rolling in because I'll know to expect a call from the Clarksons.

2023-released-items-ela-g4,1,"1 ""How's your word search going?"" Daisy's dad asked.
  
  2 ""I've found some great words, but not the perfect one for Miss Goldner,"" Daisy said.
  
  3 ""Sometimes, when I have a problem I'm trying to solve, I give myself a little time off from thinking about it,"" her dad said. . . . 
  
  4 Daisy wasn't so sure that taking time off from her quest to find the perfect word for Miss Goldner was a good idea, but she was tired of looking and didn't feel much closer to finding the right word than when she'd begun. Besides, she didn't want to miss out on a minute of the fun she and Emma had planned. ""I'll just take a little break,"" Daisy said.
  
  5 So after dinner, the girls listened to music and danced around the living room. They made a tunnel out of cushions for Lily to crawl through. They watched a silly show on television and ate brownies. After that, Daisy offered to put Lily to bed, because sometimes just being with Lily made Daisy feel better.
  
  6 They read Lily's favorite story, about a fairy who has trouble turning a prince back into a frog. Daisy tucked Lily in. ""Here comes the tickle monster!"" Daisy whispered, holding up her hands and wiggling her fingers. As Daisy tickled her, Lily laughed and laughed. And that's when it came to Daisy—the perfect word for Miss Goldner! Daisy couldn't believe her good luck. She kissed Lily good-night and ran back to her room. The word was so perfect that she wrote it in her notebook on its very own page
  
  7 The next day at school, Samantha handed Miss Goldner a big package wrapped in silver paper. Miss Goldner opened the box and admired the vase inside. Some of the other children brought gifts, too—bubble bath, a little container in the shape of an apple, a hand-made picture frame, a football and lots of wonderful homemade cards with lovely messages written inside.
  
  8 Miss Goldner thanked all the children and told them how much she would miss them, especially when she needed a dance break. Then her eyes got a little misty and a couple of tears rolled down her cheeks.
  
  9 Daisy knew it was time. She took a deep breath and raised her hand.
  
  10 ""I got you a present, too,"" she said. Miss Goldner looked around. ""Oh, it's not in a box or an envelope,"" Daisy said. 
  
  11 Miss Goldner looked surprised.
  
  12 ""I found you the perfect word,"" Daisy said proudly. 
  
  13 ""That's ridiculous,"" said Samantha. ""There's no such thing as a perfect word."" Daisy wanted to hum, but she didn't. This moment was too important. 
  
  14 ""This word is perfect for Miss Goldner,"" Daisy said. ""It's great for saying loudly and for whispering softly. It's not too long or too short, and I know both kids and grown-ups like it. It's not a made-up word, but it sounds like it could be, and it sure feels good in your mouth."" 
  
  15 ""Well,"" said Miss Goldner, wiping her eyes, ""I can hardly wait.""
  
  16 ""What is it?"" Miss Goldner asked, leaning in close to make sure she could hear.
  
  17 _""Giggle,""_ Daisy said.
  
  18 Then she extended both her hands toward Miss Goldner with a little flourish and said, ""Now, you try.""
  
  19 _""Giggle,""_ said Miss Goldner, smiling.
  
  20 _""Giggle,""_ said Emma, breaking into a grin.
  
  21 _""Giggle,""_ said Ben, starting to giggle. 
  
  22 By the time the rest of the students tried it, the whole class was laughing, even Samantha.
  
  23 Soon there was such laughter coming from Room 8 that the principal, Mrs. Joseph, came walking briskly down the hall. When she entered the room, all the children tried their best to stop laughing. But it was no use.
  
  24 ""It's my gift,"" Daisy tried to explain. ""The word _giggle,""_ she managed to get out before she burst into another round of giggles.
  
  25 Mrs. Joseph wasn't at all sure she understood what was going on in Room 8, but she loved her students to be happy and these children certainly were happy. In fact they were so happy they were all laughing—every single one.
  
  26 So Mrs. Joseph let out a big laugh herself and returned to her office.
  
  27 That afternoon Daisy and Emma walked home from school with Samantha. they talked about the day at school, and Samantha used words like _great and fun_. Daisy didn't hum at all.
  
  28 Emma left them at the corner to go to her house.

2023-released-items-ela-g4,2,"1 Someone had stolen the bananas that Jane Goodall was going to have with her evening meal. If she was concerned, it was only for a moment. Her heart leapt when she learned the identity of the culprit—David Greybeard, one of the chimpanzees she'd been studying. According to Goodall's camp cook, the chimpanzee had spent about an hour eating fruit from one of the oil palms that grew nearby. After having his fill of the nutlike fruit, he went into Goodall's tent and took her bananas. 
  
  2 It was the summer of 1961. For a year, Goodall had been studying the chimps living in Gombe Stream Reserve near Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa. She watched the chimps, observed their unique features, and gave them each his or her own name. But every time she drew closer to them, the chimps ran away in fear. The day a chimp actually visited her camp and was brave enough to enter her tent marked a breakthrough in her work. With hope that David Greybeard would reappear the next day, Goodall put out some bananas and stayed in camp instead of going into the forest as she normally would. 
  
  3 The morning passed without any sign of a chimp. As the afternoon dragged on, Goodall grew disappointed. She feared that David Greybeard's visit might have been a one-time event. However, at around 4 p.m., Goodall heard a noise in the bushes across from her tent. She watched as David Greybeard entered the camp. Just like the day before, he went to one of the oil palms and began eating nuts. When he'd had his fill, the chimp took the bananas that Goodall had left for him.
  
  4 During the next five days, the calm and curious chimp came to Goodall's camp to eat nuts three times. Each time he visited, he'd also help himself to bananas that she put out for him. About a month later, David Greybeard began feasting on the nuts that he spotted in another tree at camp. During one of these visits, the big chimp with the dense white beard showed even more trust toward his camp host. He took a banana right from Goodall's hand.
  
  5 David Greybeard's trust in Goodall made her research a great deal easier. The chimp no longer feared her and even approached her out in the forest. After seeing him interacting with Goodall, the other chimps became less afraid. In time, they let her get closer to them, too.
  
  6 As Goodall continued her studies of the chimps, she made discoveries about the animals that surprised the scientific community. She found that chimps are more like human beings than scientists had once believed. Today, more than 45 years after she first set foot in Gombe, Goodall's research continues, and she's known worldwide as the foremost expert on the behavior of chimpanzees. Goodall's career began as a childhood wish to see African animals in their natural environments. As an adult, she made that wish come true through hard work and perseverance. She also opened the door for other women to become ethnologists, scientists who study animal behavior.",*Directions Read this article.

2023-released-items-ela-g4,3,"1 From gobbling down turkey to spending time with family to watching football, Thanksgiving is filled with traditions. But one of the most popular —pulling the wishbone—dates back centuries.
  
  2 The upside-down V-shaped bone is actually called the furcula. It is an elastic bone located between a turkey's neck and its breast. _Furcula_ means ""little fork"" in Latin. All birds have a wishbone. It helps support a bird as it flies.
  
  3 For humans, though, the wishbone serves a more lighthearted purpose. At Thanksgiving, the tradition is for two people to hold one end of the bone, make a wish, and then tug. The winner is the person who ends up with the bigger piece. If you believe the legend, the winner's wish will come true.
  
  *Through the Ages*
  
  4 How did this bone-ripping tradition get started? The practice of making a wish on a bird's furcula dates back to the ancient Etruscans, a people who lived in what is today northern Italy. They believed birds were powerful and divine creatures. After killing a chicken, an Etruscan would leave the wishbone in the sun to dry. Passersby would pick it up, stroke it for good luck, and make a wish. That is how the furcula got the name ""wishbone.""
  
  5 The Etruscans passed the ritual along to the Romans. Soon, the practice of making a wish on a chicken's furcula became popular in ancient Rome. According to legend, it was so widespread that there weren't enough chickens or wishbones to go around. So the Romans began breaking the wishbone in two. Now, twice as many people could make wishes.
  
  6 Then the English picked up the tradition. In the 16th century, English settlers brought the practice to the New World. There, they found an abundance of wild turkeys. So they started using a turkey furcula for their wishes. Today a wishbone tug-of-war is as much a part of Thanksgiving as is gobbling down turkey smothered in gravy.
  
  *Mastering the Turkey Tug*
  
  7 When it comes time to pull apart the wishbone, different people have different tactics for ending up with the biggest piece. But there are a few tips that may help you get the upper hand.
  
  8 First, make sure your hands are dry. Next, make sure you hold the wishbone the right way. Take it between your thumb and index finger and place your thumb as close to the center of the bone as possible. Finally, get some leverage. The more pressure you can apply to your side of the wishbone, the better chance you have of winning the battle.
  
  9 Will your wish come true on Thanksgiving? Whether you end up with the larger or the smaller piece of the furcula is ultimately a matter of luck. But a tight grip probably couldn't hurt.",*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 26 through 31.*,"*Turkey Tug-of-War*

2023-released-items-ela-g5,1,"1 My name is Brianna Justice, and I want to be president of the whole fifth grade! 
  2 That is my ""declaration."" 
  3 As in, ""I do declare that _I will be president_ of the whole entire fifth grade at Orchard Park Elementary."" 
  4 My aunt Tina says that if we want good things to happen we have to make them happen. Take action! State your plan out loud. DECLARE! 
  
  5 And I want good things to happen. I have BIG plans. I'm going to be a millionaire with my own cooking show on TV. Cupcakes are my specialty. 
  
  6 Aunt Tina also says that along with declaring your goal, you have to have a plan. Think about what you want, decide how you plan to get it, then write it down and keep notes along the way. That's how you make a plan. All really important, successful people do, she says. (Grandpa says if Aunt Tina had a husband instead of ""just a career"" maybe she wouldn't have time for so many plans. Hmph!) Anyway, ever since a certain hometown celebrity spoke to our class last January, I've known what I need to do. Here's my plan: 
  
  7 I live in Orchard Park, Michigan. We're not far from Detroit, Michigan. But Orchard Park is a suburb. That means unless you live here, you probably never heard of it. At least, not until my hero, Miss Delicious, became world-famous as a chef, author, TV-show host, and GAZILLIONAIRE. Miss Delicious grew up right here in Orchard Park.
  
  8 And she even went to the same elementary school as me!
  9 When she spoke to our fourth-grade class, she told us that she didn't think any of her success would have been possible had it not been for the skills she learned at our school. 
  
  10 But this is the most important thing she said: 
  11 ""I honestly believe that if I hadn't been voted president of my fifth-grade class, if I hadn't learned how to manage my responsibilities back then and be a true leader, I don't know if any of this would have been possible."" 
  
  12 So the best way for me to follow in her footsteps would be to become president of my fifth-grade class, too.
  
  13 Ever since that day, every morning when I arrive at school, I pass through the front hallway where all the plaques hang or sit on shelves showing the names of all the fifth graders who have been president. And I say a tiny little prayer and run my fingers over Miss Delicious's name for good luck.
  
  14 That same day I told my friends, basically our whole class, that I was going to be just like Miss Delicious. I was going to be a millionaire cupcake baker and sell tons of books and be wildly famous on television.
  
  15 And the first step would be to become president of the fifth grade.
  16 So you see, it is so totally obvious: I have to win the election. 
  
  17 All summer I planned. I've written speeches. I've researched school-approved places for our class trip and other interests vital to our fifth-grade class.
  
  18 Little did I know how much would change once school started up after summer break. My plan seemed to be going so well, until . . .
  
  19 Except there was a new twist—the election wasn't just for each fifth-grade class to have its own president. Nuh-uh. This year for the first time in Orchard Park Elementary history, there would be only ONE fifth-grade president. . . .
  
  20 I couldn't help thinking about other challenges, other goals I'd had. Like the time I decided I needed to be the best free-throw shooter on our team. I'd written down my notes on how to stand, how to breathe, stuff coach had talked to me about, and stuff Dad helped me find online. That had been an important goal for me. And I did it!
  
  21 So was I ready to be school president and president of the whole fifth grade?
  22 YES! Yes, I was.
  23 So bring it on. It would be even better than I had imagined. And I could just see me making my acceptance speech, that is, until . . .
  
  24 Mrs. Gayle entered our classroom with a girl whose long, crinkly hair almost covered her face and said the words that will haunt me forever and ever. Mrs. Gayle said:
  
  25 ""Everyone, we have a new student. Please say hello to Jasmine Moon . . .""
  
  26 So, with only six weeks until the election a new girl just appears in fifth grade. It was like the time I fell off the jungle gym and landed flat on my back. It totally knocked the wind out of me! Because the new girl didn't just show up in our class. When she heard about the elections for president, she _nominated herself!_",*Directions Read this story.

2023-released-items-ela-g5,2,"1 Micah herded his two woolly sheep to his neighbor's tent. He hoped to trade them for a cow that could pull his plow. Many thousands of years ago, in Micah's time, people didn't use money. They got the things they needed by bartering—trading goods and services—with their neighbors. A deal was final when both people agreed that it was a fair trade.
  
  2 As populations grew, simple exchanges between neighbors didn't always work. The products people wanted were not always available. Also, it was often difficult to agree on the value of the goods or services being traded. Large marketplaces began to grow, where people from many villages and cities could trade with each other.
  
  3 Marketplaces provided a wide selection of goods, but they also created a need for a new system of trading. Ancient people needed something with a value everyone agreed on —money.
  
  4 The first money developed was ""commodity"" money. Commodities are things that everyone values enough to accept as payment. The commodities used for trade varied from place to place, depending on what the local people valued. For example, around 5,000 years ago, barley was a main source of food for the people of ancient Mesopotamia. Everyone valued barley, so the grain was used for trade.
  
  5 Around 1,000 years later, people in China used cowrie shells to buy the things they needed. In many countries on the Mediterranean Sea, salt was important for preserving food. Because salt was valuable, it was used as money. At different times, in different places, other commodities were used for trade: fishhooks, leather, beads, feathers, and even whales' teeth.
  
  6 The commodity system worked well, but it wasn't perfect. Sometimes, the commodities valued by the majority of people weren't valued by others. Also, the specific commodities had their own sets of problems. Salt, for example, wasn't easy to store and would dissolve if it got wet. And carrying a pile of fishhooks could be a prickly situation! The citizens of Yap, an island country in the Pacific Ocean, used stone disks for money. Some of them were 12 feet in diameter and weighed 500 pounds. You can imagine the problems those might have caused.
  
  7 In different parts of the world, people began to see the need for some kind of standard money. It had to be valuable to everyone, easy to carry, and hard to destroy. Small metal coins provided the answer.
  
  8 The first coins were made of metal by Greek settlers living in Lydia (now Turkey) about 2,600 years ago. The coins were made from a metal called electrum, a mixture of silver and gold. The king's symbol—a lion's head—was stamped onto each coin to remind the people of Lydia that their king approved of their money. The coins had specific values and weights.
  9 Use of coins spread rapidly throughout the Mediterranean world. The Romans also used coins, and Roman traders and soldiers spent Roman coins in other parts of the world. Soon other cities and countries began making their own coins, too.
  
  10 Chinese coins were made with holes in the center so they could be carried on strings. After paper was invented, the Chinese began to print pictures of their coins on pieces of paper, creating the first paper money. Heavy strings of coins could now be exchanged for a single sheet of paper.
  
  11 When the first British colonists arrived in North America in the early 1600s, they bartered with each other and with the American Indians they met. Much later, the government of the new United States established its own money system, using dollars and cents. (As you know, the dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, or pennies.) At first only coins were used in the United States. Then, the first bills were printed in the mid 1800s. Because green ink was used on the back of the bills, they were called greenbacks.
  
  12 In the United States today, we not only use coins and bills, but we also write checks and use credit cards. However, many people still use the ancient system of bartering for goods and services. If you've ever traded a bag of chips for some cookies or exchanged baseball cards with a friend, then you, too, have bartered.
  
  13 Some money experts think that one day, bills and coins will no longer be used. Instead, all transactions will be made electronically. When and if that happens, however, do you think people will stop bartering with each other?",*Directions Read this article.

2023-released-items-ela-g5,3,"1 Benny was happy in the mission home. But sometimes before he went to sleep at night, he would gaze at the stars outside his dormitory window and long for the day when he would be a grown-up man. He would use a net, like the Big Dipper in the sky, to catch splendid silver salmon. Benny would be strong, like the Great Bear, a larger group of stars of which the Big Dipper was a part. Like the great strong bear of the night, Benny would be strong himself.
  
  2 The North Star would guide his boat. Benny knew that when Alaska became a state someday, it would be the northernmost state in the United States. Sometimes when the sky was scattered with hundreds of stars, it reminded Benny of a field of forget-me-nots, the little star-shaped flowers that grow wild everywhere. The blue sky was a roof that covered Benny's Alaska at night. . . .
  
  3 When fall came, school started again just as it does for children everywhere. But the winter came quickly. The first snowy day Benny went to school wearing a parka, mukluks, which are fur lined boots, and thick mittens to keep his fingers warm. He looked more like a furry bear than a boy! . . .
  
  4 That day in school the teacher told the children that there was a contest to make a flag for Alaska. With all his heart Benny wanted to win the contest. He thought how grand it would be to see his flag carried in a parade, or hung on the masts of big ships that came to the village in the summertime. He thought how especially grand it would be to see his flag flying on the fishing boat he would have one day.
  
  5 The night the boys and girls at the mission house collected crayons, paint, and paper, and made many, many designs for the flag. They sat around a big table, and as they worked, they talked and laughed and sometimes held up their designs for the others to see. But Benny sat quietly, thinking and thinking. For once no one could see his happy, friendly smile. He was thinking of what he loved the most about Alaska.
  
  6 Suddenly Benny knew what he wanted his flag to be like. He wanted his flag to be like the stars he dreamed by—gold stars spread out like the Big Dipper in the blue sky. So that is what he painted. And underneath it he wrote these words: ""The blue field is for the sky and the forget-me-not, an Alaskan flower. The North Star is for the future state of Alaska, the most northerly of the Union. The dipper is for the Great Bear—symbolizing strength.""
  
  7 Some of the children drew pictures of the beautiful snow-covered mountains in Alaska. Some drew pictures of the big fish that can be caught in Alaska. Some drew pictures of the northern lights that sometimes cross the sky. Some drew pictures of the Alaskan forests. Some drew pictures of the Alaskan glaciers, and some drew pictures of the Alaskan rivers. And some drew star designs or stripe designs or flower designs.
  8 Benny didn't show his paper to anyone. He was too shy. He thought the other children's designs were much better than his. Still, the next day he gave his paper to the teacher when she collected the others.
  
  9 A month went by, and the teacher didn't mention the contest again. Benny ice-skated with the other children. And so the winter went quickly by.
  
  10 And suddenly the snow and ice began to melt. Benny no longer wore his parka and mukluks and mittens. He began to watch for the forget-me-nots in the drying fields as he walked to school.
  
  11 He watched the fishermen mend their nets for the coming fishing season. He watched the world change from white to green.
  
  12 Then, one day, when school was almost over, the teacher called the children together.
  
  13 ""Children,"" she said, ""the flag contest is ended. From all over Alaska boys and girls sent in designs for the flag. From northern Nome to the busy cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks . . . from the fishing towns of Seward and Petersburg to Juneau, the capital, and lumber towns of Ketchikan . . . from everywhere came hundreds of designs.
  
  14 ""And . . . boys and girls! Benny's design has won the contest! From now on, Benny's design will be Alaska's flag!""
  
  15 What a proud and happy boy Benny was! And what an especially proud and happy boy he was on the Fourth of July. For on that day in the village a big parade celebrated the holiday. Everyone came—to see the marchers in their bright uniforms, the baton twirlers, the banners—but the very first thing they saw was BENNY.

2023-released-items-ela-g6,1,"""1 ""I had his name picked out the day we loaded him on the trailer: Ranger, because it made me think of courage and stamina^1, adventure and exploration. (I should have called him Houdini^2, or Trouble, or Bucksnort or something instead, as it turned out.)
  
  2 It was dusk by the time we hauled him home, so I tossed him some hay, showed him where the water tank was, and then left him to settle in. Ghost whinnied a greeting from her own pasture, so I knew Ranger wouldn't feel too alone. I couldn't wait to spend a full day with him, to touch him for the first time, to see what he was like and how he might react to things. But as I jogged toward the corral gate early that first morning, confusion and a sick, cold dread seeped into my bones.
  
  3 Ghost was dozing quietly, but Ranger was nowhere to be seen. . . . 
  
  4 Panic sank sharp claws into my shoulders and hissed prickly dragon breath down the back of my neck. Ranger was wild, untouched. If he'd managed to get out of his safe corral, how on earth could I catch him again?
  
  5 A loud whinny broke the stillness of the morning, and hoofbeats thundered behind me. Ranger galloped into view along the edge of the cornfield, hooves kicking puffs of dust and tail streaming behind him like a banner.
  
  6 ""What are you doing out here?"" I cried. ""How did you escape?"" 
  
  7 He tossed his head, almost as if he were laughing at me, and jumped back into the pen with another whinny. . . .
  
  8 ""Ranger! You just jumped a six-foot fence from a standstill!"" I'd guessed he was athletic, but I'd never seen a horse clear a jump like that with such little effort.
  
  9 He flicked his ears at me, spun on his back legs, and promptly jumped out again. Just to prove he could, I suppose. . . .
  
  10 I spent the next few weeks letting him get used to the sound of my voice, the rhythm of my movements. Whenever Dad didn't need my help, I sat on an upturned bucket while Ranger nibbled hay or grass, hoping to prove I wasn't a threat. I tried offering treats—flaxseed cookies, oatmeal biscuits, peppermints, even a scoop of Mom's apple crisp—but mustangs off the range are skeptical of new flavors, and Ranger didn't believe he could eat any of these things. I brought a carrot out once, but the crisp snap as I broke it in pieces sent him bucking across the pen. . . .
  
  11 One day, toward the end of summer, I brought a couple of carrots out for Ghost. She nickered eagerly when she saw me reach into my pocket. Ranger jumped out of his pen to join us in her pasture, curiosity nudging him closer. When he saw the mare take a piece of carrot from my palm and heard her crunch it, he tiptoed toward her so he could breathe into her face and sniff her muzzle.
  
  12 _What is she eating?_ he seemed to ask.
  
  13 Carefully, I offered him a piece of carrot, too. 
  
  14 It took him a long moment to make up his mind, but he finally pinched it in his lips and took a single, hesitant bite. His eyes widened. His ears flicked forward. He crunched again, drool slipping from his mouth as he chewed. He gobbled that carrot down, looking to me for another. _What deliciousness is this?_ his expression seemed to say. _And how can I get more?_
  
  15 Carrots proved the key to his training from that moment on. I used them as rewards when he stood for haltering, when he learned to walk beside me as I held the lead rope, when he let me pick up his feet.
  
  16 Some horses turn greedy for treats, pushing and shoving in their eagerness to eat something tasty. I only gave Ghost treats on rare occasions; otherwise, she got rude. But Ranger remained polite, even when he realized I always carried his carrots in my pockets. If he felt his efforts weren't being rewarded quickly or often enough, he might gently nudge my pocket with his nose to get my attention, but then he'd take a couple of steps back to wait patiently while I dug a bit of carrot out for him.
  
  17 Carrots taught him that humans could be trusted, despite his strong instincts to flee strangers. After school started, I begged my friends to stop by with carrots for him, and Ranger started to look forward to meeting new people. It was quite a surprise for a work crew building a new grain bin on our farm a few months later when he jumped out of the pasture and came galloping up to check the contents of their lunch coolers!""","Directions Read this story.

The word for hummingbird means ""kiss the flower."" The French seemed especially struck by its little body, naming it ""fly-sized bird.""
  
  2 Hummers are the smallest birds in the world. The calliope hummingbird is the tiniest in North America. Full-grown, it is as short as your thumb and weighs less than a penny. . . .
  
  3 All hummingbirds wear thick coats. For their size, they produce more feathers than any other bird. And on many hummers, some of these feathers gleam like colorful jewels in the bright sunshine. Stand between a hummingbird and the sun—with the light to your back—and you'll witness the flash as the bird faces the sun. WOW! But when the light or the angle isn't right, the brilliance disappears and the bright colors fade to drab.
  
  *Where in the World*
  
  4 Hummingbirds live where flowers bloom—but only in the western half of the world. The birds all make their homes in North, Central, and South America. Most kinds live in hot jungles. Others do well in cooler climates. Rufous hummingbirds, for instance, spend part of each year in Alaska.
  
  5 Look for hummingbirds of one kind or another in very different types of homes: sea coasts, forests, mountain meadows, deserts, and grassy plains. The birds raise their families in the wilderness, but also in busy city parks and backyard gardens. If you set out a feeder of sugary water, hummingbirds will often arrive for dinner. Some become so comfortable around people, they perch on fingers to eat. . . .
  
  6 Twice each year, a few kinds of hummingbirds migrate long distances between their summer and winter homes. Ruby-throated and rufous hummers fly more than 3200 kilometres (2000 miles) from their nesting sites in the north to their winter homes in the south. About 800 kilometres (500 miles) of the ruby-throated's long journey is across the Gulf of Mexico. It's an amazing trip, which the hummingbirds make nonstop, and usually alone.
  
  *World Full of Food*
  
  7 Imagine eating six times an hour. That's nothing for a hummingbird. It normally feeds every 10 minutes—sometimes more often—downing about 60 meals a day!
  
  8 Hummingbirds are so active they burn up energy fast. One scientist figured that if an average man used as much energy as a ruby-throated hummingbird, he would need to eat 130 kilograms (285 pounds) of hamburger every day. And before the ruby-throated migrates, it stores energy by eating even more than usual, growing about 50 percent heavier. The extra weight slows its speed, but it helps the bird fly farther.
  
  9 A hummingbird feeds mostly on nectar—the sweet liquid formed inside flowers. The bird sticks its long tongue into a blossom and laps the nectar. The liquid rises through grooves along the tongue. Then the bird draws its tongue back in. Its beak squeezes the nectar off when the bird sticks its tongue out again. To get enough food, a hummer might need to check out 3000 blossoms in a single day. . . .
  
  *World in Motion*
  
  10 Hummingbirds are most at home in the air. They're champion acrobats of the sky! Not only can they zoom forward like other birds, they can also go backward. As they move from flower to flower, they flit sideways easily. If flying upside down might help the hummers escape danger, they can do that, too—for short distances. But most amazingly of all, they can hover^1 in midair.
  
  11 Narrow, pointed wings help make these acrobatics possible. They're strong, too. The muscles that move them weigh at least one-quarter as much as the whole bird. And the hummingbird moves its wings in an odd way, tracing figure eights in the air. That helps it create power on both the upbeat and the downbeat. Depending on the kind of hummer and what it's doing, it often beats its wings more than 40 times a second!
  
  12 For its size, the hummingbird travels at a quick pace. The ruby-throated has been tracked at 43 kilometres (27 miles) an hour. It flies—and dives—much faster when it's trying to attract a mate or respond to threats. But traveling at full speed doesn't end in crash landings. A hummer can make sudden stops—even on a narrow perch—with grace. . . .
  
  *New World*
  
  13 When the little hummers are only two to three weeks old, they start flying. They're surprisingly good right away, but they have to work to improve their landing skills. Then they can follow their mother from flower to flower and learn to feed as she does. The chicks also practice chasing and catching insects in the air. Sometimes, they chase each other, too—just for fun.""",*Directions Read this article. Then answer questions 22 through 28.*,"*Excerpt from Welcome to the World of Hummingbirds*

2023-released-items-ela-g6,3,"""1 The rice room—the mai fong—was the generic^1 name for an area in the back of our father's restaurant.
  
  2 From the time of my birth in 1945 until they sold the restaurant ten years later, the cafe at 710 Webster Street was my home away from home.
  
  3 Sometimes, it was just plain home. . . .
  
  4 To us, the kitchen was a mysterious place. Our kitchen at home was so simple: an old Sparks stove, a refrigerator, sink, and table. At the New Eastern, it was a bustling factory. Almost an entire wall was taken up by a line of gigantic black woks^2. This was my father's stage. He strode the length of the four woks, each one fired up by gas flames underneath. Beneath him, planks of wood, raised off the ground an inch or two, served to give his legs and feet some spring, and to allow food particles to drip through, to be swept off the floor later.
  
  5 The sink was the size of a bathtub; the refrigerator had glass doors and stretched three times as wide as the one at home. Every appliance was bigger, and there were things we never saw anywhere else, like the big cylindrical metal oven in which my father draped rods holding large marinated pieces of pork loin. We could hear the fire roaring from the bottom of this loo-how. My dad would go about his business, and then, always at exactly the right time, he'd wander over, lift off the top, and pluck out several rods of barbecued pork—glowing bright red, with black at the tips.
  
  6 If I happened by at that magical moment, I'd stop. _""Yeet-gow!""_ I'd say. One piece. And, taking a big Chinese cleaver, he'd deftly^3 chop off a piece of the succulent^4, sweet meat. ""One dollah!"" he'd shout, then hand it over.
  
  7 My father made the best food in town. Every now and then, he'd make a batch of _Jah-Don_—which meant ""bombs,"" but which tasted infinitely better. They were Chinese cream puffs without the cream, but liberally dipped in sugar.
  
  8 There was nothing he wouldn't try. If he tasted a candy he liked, he'd try to duplicate it himself. He was proud of a rock candy he whipped up once and determined to sell at the front counter of the New Eastern. We, of course, served as his guinea pigs, and we couldn't bring ourselves to tell him the sad truth: The candy was so hard that it was inedible. I rolled a piece around my mouth. ""Tastes good, Ba-Ba"" I said. Then, when he looked away, I spat it out.
  
  9 Life in a Chinese restaurant gave us access to some strange snacks, most of which we grew to like. There were the moy, the salted or sugared preserved plums given so freely as gifts. The salted ones set off ticklish explosions inside our mouths, but once we adjusted, nothing rivaled the satisfaction of working the plum around, getting down to the plum seed.
  
  10 There were the pickled scallions we'd pluck out of the jar, bulbous onion heads that we thought of as candy. Sometimes, Dad would get a sugar cane or two at the produce market and chop off inch-long pieces for us to suck on.
  
  11 When we ventured beyond the rice room and kitchen, into the dining room, we'd run into the waiter, Gim Bok. He was a tall, spindly^5 man with rimless glasses and thinning hair who liked to spin stories to us. Watching my little sister Shirley nibbling on an apple, he'd lean over.
  
  12 ""Don't eat the seed,"" he said, ""or an apple tree will grow inside you.""
  
  13 ""What?""

2023-released-items-ela-g7,1,"""1 When I started high school, I was fourteen years old and six foot ten. The scary thing about being so tall when you're so young is that people automatically treat you as if you're older. Size implies maturity. Yes, I was the size of an adult (actually, bigger than most!), but I was still just a kid. And acting more like an adult wouldn't win me any friends. As a card-carrying^1 Good Boy, I wanted to meet adults' expectations and get their praise, but as a Regular Kid, I wanted to be like my peers and get their friendship. . . . 
  
  2 I walked into school that first day resplendent^2 in my blue blazer and slacks, the school uniform. We all looked like baby-faced accountants in training. I noticed some of my old classmates from St. Jude, the ones who had turned their backs on me, and we continued our policy of actively ignoring one another. I felt the pain of their betrayal, but I forced my face to remain expressionless. I couldn't let them see that they had hurt me. I shoved the pain deep down into the coldest part of my heart. I was here to study hard at academics and to work hard at basketball under my new coach, Jack Donahue. I was here to excel. Nothing else mattered.
  
  3 I did excel. I made the honor roll my first semester, pleasing my parents and teachers. Learning came naturally to me. I loved reading, especially about history and adventure stories like _The Three Musketeers_. Basketball, however, I had to work at to do well in. But the fierce competitor that had been awakened in me loved challenges. . . . 
  
  4 My refuge^3 from the explosive turmoil^4 outside, and the implosive turmoil I had started to feel inside, was basketball. The practices were so exhausting that I barely had time to think about anything else. Every school day I crawled out of bed early, went to school, practiced basketball until five o'clock, staggered home, powered through my homework, zoned out in front of the TV, and went to bed.
  
  5 Weekends, I hung out with my only close friend left in the projects, Norbert. We would shut ourselves in my room to play chess and talk about our plans for the future. He was determined to become a draftsman, making detailed drawings for engineers who were inventing wonderful new machines. I was going to be an architect and create futuristic buildings like the ones we saw on the TV show _The Jetsons_.
  
  6 Because the civil rights movement was in the news every day, both of us had started to take an interest in finding out more about our ethnic origins.
  
  7 ""You know, we invented the yo-yo,"" Norbert, who was part Filipino, bragged one day in my room. . . . 
  
  8 Then I'd put on the latest jazz album by Sonny Rollins and say, ""Yeah, but we invented that."" 
  
  9 And back and forth we'd go, trying to one-up the other in a cultural heritage version of rock, paper, scissors. This kind of competition required that we do research. We even took the subway to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to find out more about Filipino and African cultures. Most important, I had a friend in whom I could confide any thought or feeling, knowing he would never make fun of me.
  
  10 The demands of high school cut into the time I could spend with Norbert. I had the studying part down, but the basketball part was as rocky as ever. As a freshman, my style of play reflected my personality: politely passive. I had some skills, but I didn't have an aggressive nature. The good players around me knew how to play rough, use their bodies with authority, and power their way to a rebound. I felt like a pinball bouncing off players rather than making them bounce off me. I knew I had to toughen up, and I was committed to getting better, but it wasn't happening fast enough. . . . 
  
  11 On the morning our varsity team was scheduled to play a preconference game against Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, Coach Donahue surprised me by taking me into his office. I figured he was going to discuss his disappointment in my progress as a player, maybe even say something about it all being a big mistake. That I didn't belong. Instead, he handed me a varsity uniform.
  
  12 ""You'll be suiting up against Erasmus today,"" he said.
  
  13 I just stood there, the folded uniform in my hand. Was this a joke? 
  
  14 ""Don't you have a class to go to?"" he asked. He pretended to be all business, but I could tell by the slight grin he was enjoying my dumbfounded reaction.
  
  15 When I unfolded the jersey, I saw the number 33—the one I had picked in seventh grade to honor the football player Mel Triplett. Even my fear of playing poorly and letting everyone down couldn't overcome my pride at walking out of his office with that uniform. I had no idea that would be the number I would wear for the rest of my basketball career. I hurried away on a mission to tell anyone who would listen that I would be playing varsity that afternoon. All day, as I sat in classes and walked the hallways and ate lunch, I allowed myself to imagine the game and the parts where I scored impossible shots, made incredible passes, snagged rebounds like a machine. Would the team insist on carrying me out of the gym on their shoulders or just award me the game ball?
  
  16 Neither. We got slaughtered. Afterward, I sat in the locker room and cried.""",*Read this poem. Then answer questions 22 through 28.*,"*Excerpt from Becoming Kareem: Growing Up On and Off the Court*

2023-released-items-ela-g7,3,"""1 When we stopped at the grocery store, Mom said she wanted comfort food, something warm and filling. I wished I knew how to make vegetarian paella and chocolate-dipped churros, the special treats my abuelita made for us whenever we visited Mom's parents down in Florida. But that wasn't what I was craving, anyhow. So I sent Mom to get flour and sugar while Josh and I filled the cart with cottage cheese, eggs, apples, and raisins. Ingredients for Cottage Cheese Contraption—one of the holdovers from our days at Ahimsa House. Everyone took turns cooking, so some nights we had gourmet Indian stir-fry or fancy Italian pasta dishes, and other nights we had unidentifiable casseroles made with cream of mushroom soup from a can. 
  
  2 Or Cottage Cheese Contraption, invented by an old woman everyone called Granny. She'd been a housewife in Arkansas for fifty years, and when her husband died, she packed all her essential belongings into one suitcase, sold everything else, and took off on a road trip across the country. A year later, she landed in Takoma Park, at Ahimsa House. She'd lived there ever since, grandmothering every lost and lonely kid who came through. 
  
  3 Josh was two when we left Ahimsa House, too young to remember anything about it. But he loved hearing stories about the people who lived there. About the days when Dad was a grad student in Renaissance literature and drama at Georgetown, when Mom served chai lattes at the Sunflower Café and played jazz piano at fancy DC nightclubs on the weekends. I'd shown Josh pictures of Mom in a tiny black dress at one of her gigs, a choker of pearls around her throat. She was unrecognizable, her eyes outlined in smoky makeup, her long hair loose down her back, a white rose tucked behind her ear. . . . 
  
  4 When Josh was five, he discovered the cello. It happened at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Mom was excited because it was an all-Haydn program—the ""Farewell"" Symphony and a cello concerto. Mom's always said, _Haydn is the underappreciated Einstein of the music world_. Whenever she was upset or stressed in those days, she sat down at the piano and took out her big tattered book of Haydn sonatas, held together with a rubber band, loose pages sticking out everywhere. Now she hardly ever has time to play the piano, and all her music sits neatly stacked in milk crates along the wall.
  
  5 I remember the ""Farewell"" Symphony, how at the end the musicians all got up, one by one, switched off their stand lights, and walked off into the wings, until there were just two lonely violinists still playing by themselves. And I remember the cello soloist, his wild curly hair flopping all over the place like a lion's mane while he played, the way he made the cello sound like it was singing. But mostly I remember Josh, sitting there with his lips parted, as if he were getting ready to take a bite of ice cream but forgot what he was doing and froze in place. When it was over and the cellist took his final bow and left the stage, Josh burst into tears and wailed, ""Make the cello man come back!"" Mom and Dad were shocked. Josh barely ever complained or whined or asked for anything. The next day, Mom signed him up for cello lessons at the Prep. 
  
  6 Thinking about all this while I unpacked the Cottage Cheese Contraption ingredients on the kitchen counter, I had an idea. ""Josh, why don't you play me some cooking music?""
  
  7 Dad always used to tell me to play ""cooking music"" on my violin when I wanted to help him with dinner but was too young to be much use. I suspect it was also a sneaky way of getting me to practice, even for only ten or fifteen minutes. I never had the discipline Josh seemed to be born with.
  
  8 Josh had wilted a little when we walked into the empty house, but brightened up at my suggestion. He ran upstairs and came down slowly, carrying his cello with both hands, his rock stop^1 slung over one shoulder. He settled himself on one of the chairs at the kitchen table and started playing movements from the Bach cello suites from memory.
  
  9 I cracked eggs, stirred cottage cheese and flour and sugar together, chopped apples, tossed in raisins, and fried it all into a delicious hot mush, while Josh ""talked"" to me. That's how I thought of it—this was Josh's way of saying the things he didn't know how to express in words.""","*Read this story. Then answer questions 29 through 35.*

2023-released-items-ela-g7,4,"""1 When Elizabeth ""Liz"" Bedell, a 23-year-old staff member in the U.S. House of Representatives, was growing up in Medford, Mass., she dismissed as ""family myth"" a story her grandfather often told about his Aunt Grace Bedell. He claimed she wrote to Abe Lincoln when she was a little girl and received a letter in return.
  
  2 ""My grandfather used to tell us we had a footnote in history,"" Liz Bedell explained. ""We were a working-class family. To impress people, he'd say, ‘Oh, we are descendants of Grace Bedell. When she was a little girl she wrote to Abe Lincoln and suggested he grow a beard so he could win the election.
  
  3 ""I didn't believe him,"" Liz Bedell said. ""None of us did."" 
  
  4 Imagine her surprise this spring as she was browsing through the Library's Lincoln bicentennial exhibition, ""With Malice Toward None,""^1 and happened upon a case containing two short, handwritten letters, one dated Oct. 15, 1860, addressed to Hon.^2 A.B. Lincoln and signed by Grace Bedell, the other dated Oct. 19, 1860, addressed to ""My dear little Miss"" and signed A. Lincoln.
  
  5 ""I almost died,"" Bedell said. ""I called my father. He said, ‘Are you serious? My father was telling the truth all this time.' "" 
  
  6 She wrote in the Library's exhibition visitors' log: ""I cried my eyes out when I saw the letter from Grace Bedell to Abe Lincoln—she's my great-great aunt, and I grew up with the story not really believing it. Elizabeth Bedell."" 
  
  7 ""I felt very emotional,"" Bedell said later. ""I wished I could call my grandfather (Kenneth Bedell, who in 2005 died at age 95) and say ‘You were right.' "" 
  
  8 Her grandfather encouraged her to pursue a lifelong interest in politics. ""In fifth grade, I wanted to be president of the United States. In the eighth grade, I wanted to be a Supreme Court justice. Then I wanted to be president again,"" she said. 
  
  9 ""Grandpa used to tell me, ‘You can do anything you want. You can be president. Why, just look at your great-great aunt Grace Bedell. She couldn't vote, but she put pen to paper.' ""
  
  10 After majoring in political science and graduating several years ago from New York University in New York City, Liz Bedell became a special-education teacher. When Barack Obama ran for president, she jumped into the campaign. A field organizer, she worked in North Carolina, Alaska and New Hampshire. With the campaign over, three months ago she landed a job in the Washington office of Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, D-N.Y. ^3 
  
  11 That's how Bedell happened to visit the Lincoln exhibition a second time. She came to the Library after work on May 8 for a special exhibition tour arranged for members of Congress and their staffs by the Library's Congressional Relations Office. 
  
  12 There, she heard exhibition curator^4 John Sellers tell the story of 11-year-old Grace Bedell writing to Lincoln to suggest he would have more voter appeal if he grew a beard. ""I have got 4 brother's and part of them will vote for you any way and if you will let your whiskers grow I will try and get the rest of them to vote for you you would look a great deal better for your face is so thin,"" wrote Miss Bedell. ""All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husband's to vote for you and then you would be President.""
  
  13 Miss Bedell continued, "". . . if I was a man I would vote for you to but I will try and get every one to vote you that I can.""
  
  14 In his prompt reply, Lincoln asked, ""As to the whiskers, having never worn any, do you not think people would call it a piece of silly affectation^5 if I were to begin now?"" 
  
  15 Sellers said Lincoln later had his train stop in Fredonia, N.Y., close to Bedell's hometown of Westfield, where he had arranged to have her in the crowd. He stepped onto the platform and called for her and leaned down and kissed her cheek. ""She was so flustered, she ran off, still carrying a bouquet of flowers she had meant to give Lincoln,"" Sellers said.
  
  16 He explained that this Lincoln exhibition was the first time, to his knowledge, that the two letters had been displayed together.""",*Read this article. Then answer questions 36 through 42.*,"*The Advice of a Little Girl: Lincoln Exhibition Confirms a Family Myth*

2023-released-items-ela-g8,1,"""1 My exams went fairly well, and my grades were satisfactory if not stellar^1. In my final semester I signed up for a journalism course. Other students in the class were hoping to become newspaper reporters; I was more interested in magazine work and submitted a photo-essay—pictures of doorways with very little text—for an assignment. The professor was the advisor for the Cornell Alumni^2 News, and he thought the editor might want to feature my photographs of campus buildings. The editor looked them over and paid me five dollars each for three pictures. It seemed like a fortune! When the magazine came out, several graduates of the department of architecture wrote to praise the pictures, and one alumnus suggested that I specialize in architectural photography. He said my pictures were that good. It was the encouragement I craved. 
  
  2 But I wasn't sure that with no professional experience I could actually land such a job —and I did need to find work. To play it safe, I sent an application to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. ^ e curator of herpetology^3 invited me to come for an interview. He seemed so impressed by my application that I thought the offer of a position might be imminent^4.
  
  3 I was nearly twenty-two, about to graduate, and unsure which to follow—my head and my long interest in natural science, or my heart and my passion for photography. A job at the museum would be the safe choice. Or I could try to pursue a career in architectural photography, even though I had no specific training in the field. I had to know if the men who praised my photographs were right, or if they simply enjoyed my pictures of their alma mater^5. My future hung in the balance. 
  
  4 I asked the letter-writer to recommend someone qualified to give me an objective opinion. His reply: ""See Benjamin Moskowitz, York & Sawyer, Architects, NYC. Good luck.""
  
  5 During the Easter vacation I booked a cheap room and took the train to New York City, where I arrived late on Thursday and went straight to the Park Avenue address of York & Sawyer. At their office on the twenty-third floor I asked the switchboard operator for Mr. Moskowitz. 
  
  6 ""I think Mr. Moskowitz has already left, miss. I know he was planning a long weekend. Did you have an appointment?"" . . . 
  
  7 She sighed and asked my name and told me to wait while she tried to see if he might still be there. I paced nervously, thinking that my time and money and my best chance for an expert opinion had been thrown away. The operator rang his office; no answer. ""Sorry, but it looks like you're out of luck, Miss White,"" she said. 
  
  8 Why hadn't I planned this better? Called for an appointment? Taken an earlier train? How could I have made such a mistake? I was close to tears. 
  
  9 Just then a tall, gray-haired man, beautifully groomed, strode through the reception area. The switchboard operator signaled me and mouthed, ""That's him."" 
  
  10 I didn't hesitate. ""Oh, Mr. Moskowitz!"" I called out. ""Just a moment, sir, please! I'd like to speak to you."" 
  
  11 He glanced at his expensive-looking gold watch and kept walking. ""Sorry, I have a train to catch,"" he said brusquely. ""I don't believe you had an appointment."" 
  
  12 I hurried after him toward the elevator. ""I apologize, sir, but I was told to talk to you and to show you some photographs."" I mentioned the Cornell graduate who had given me his name. . . . 
  
  13 ""Miss White, I have a train to catch. I'm sure your photographs are very good or he would not have sent you to see me, but unfortunately I have no time to look at them or talk to you now."" 
  
  14 He checked his watch impatiently and rang again for the elevator. ""It's always slow when I'm most in a hurry"" he muttered. 
  
  15 ""Let me show you just one photograph while we're waiting,"" I pleaded, and opened the portfolio. The picture on top was a view of the river from the library tower, the highest point on campus. I'd climbed that tower at dawn and at sunset and at every possible time in between to catch the light on the water at exactly the right moment and framed the shot through lacy grillwork. 
  
  16 Mr. Moskowitz glanced at it, impatiently at first and then more carefully a second time. ""You took this photograph?"" he asked doubtfully. 
  
  17 ""Yes, these pictures are all my work."" I rushed through my story—the elevator could arrive at any moment. ""Mr. Moskowitz, I have to know if you think I have the ability to become a professional in this field."" 
  
  18 The elevator gate clattered open. ""Going down!""
  
  19 ""Never mind, Chester,"" Mr. Moskowitz told the operator. ""We don't need you now."" He motioned for me to follow him. ""Come with me. I want to have a look at the rest of these."" 
  
  20 As we hurried through the reception room, Mr. Moskowitz called out to the switchboard operator, ""Ring up Sawyer and York and anyone else who's still here and tell them to come to the conference room."" . . . 
  
  21 For the next hour they asked me questions about my age—I fibbed a bit, adding a couple of years—my education, and my experience. At the end of the hour I walked out of the offices of York & Sawyer with their assurance that any architect in the country would willingly pay for my services. I wanted to celebrate, and when I stopped for something to eat, I could scarcely keep from telling my good news to the tired-looking waitress behind the counter.""","*Read this story.

2023-released-items-ela-g8,2,"""1. Miyax pushed back the hood of her sealskin parka and looked at the Arctic sun. It was a yellow disc in a lime-green sky, the colors of six o'clock in the evening and the time when wolves awoke. Quietly she put down her cooking pot and crept to the top of a dome-shaped frost heave, one of the many earth buckles that rise and fall in the crackling cold of the Arctic winter. Lying on her stomach, she looked across a vast lawn of grass and moss and focused her attention on the wolves she had come upon two sleeps ago. They were wagging their tails as they awoke and saw each other.
  
  2. Her hands trembled, and her heartbeat quickened, for she was frightened, not so much of the wolves, who were shy and many harpoon-shots away, but because of her desperate predicament. Miyax was lost. She had been lost without food for many sleeps on the North Slope of Alaska. The barren slope stretches for two hundred miles from the Brooks Range to the Arctic Ocean, and for more than eight hundred miles from Canada to the Chukchi Sea. No roads cross it; ponds and lakes freckle its immensity. Winds scream across it, and the view in every direction is exactly the same. Somewhere in this cosmos was Miyax, and the very life in her body, its spark and warmth, depended upon these wolves for survival. And she was not so sure they would help. . . .
  
  3. She had been watching the wolves for two days, trying to discern^1 which of their sounds and movements expressed goodwill and friendship. Most animals had such signals. The little Arctic ground squirrels flicked their tails sideways to notify others of their kind that they were friendly. By imitating this signal with her forefinger, Miyax had lured many a squirrel to her hand. If she could discover such a gesture for the wolves, she would be able to make friends with them and share their food, like a bird or a fox.
  
  4. Propped on her elbows with her chin in her fists, she stared at the black wolf, trying to catch his eye. She had chosen him because he was much larger than the others, and because he walked like her father, Kapugen, with his head high and his chest out. The black wolf also possessed wisdom, she had observed. The pack looked to him when the wind carried strange scents or the birds cried nervously. If he was alarmed, they were alarmed. If he was calm, they were calm.
  
  5. Long minutes passed, and the black wolf did not look at her. He had ignored her since she first came upon them, two sleeps ago. True, she moved slowly and quietly, so as not to alarm him; yet she did wish he would see the kindness in her eyes. Many animals could tell the difference between hostile hunters and friendly people by merely looking at them. But the big black wolf would not even glance her way.
  
  6. A bird stretched in the grass. The wolf looked at it. A flower twisted in the wind. He glanced at that. Then the breeze rippled the wolverine ruff on Miyax's parka, and it glistened in the light. He did not look at that. She waited. Patience with the ways of nature had been instilled in her by her father. And so she knew better than to move or shout. Yet she must get food or die. Her hands shook slightly, and she swallowed hard to keep calm. . . .
  
  7. Amaroq^2 glanced at his paw and slowly turned his head her way without lifting his eyes. He licked his shoulder. A few matted hairs sprang apart and twinkled individually. Then his eyes sped to each of the three adult wolves that made up his pack and finally to the five pups who were sleeping in a fuzzy mass near the den entrance. The great wolf's eyes softened at the sight of the little wolves, then quickly hardened into brittle yellow jewels as he scanned the flat tundra.
  
  8. Not a tree grew anywhere to break the monotony of the gold-green plain, for the soils of the tundra are permanently frozen. Only moss, grass, lichens, and a few hardy flowers take root in the thin upper layer that thaws briefly in summer. Nor do many species of animals live in this rigorous^3 land, but those creatures that do dwell here exist in bountiful numbers. Amaroq watched a large cloud of Lapland longspurs wheel up into the sky, then alight in the grasses. Swarms of crane flies, one of the few insects that can survive the cold, darkened the tips of the mosses. Birds wheeled, turned, and called. Thousands sprang up from the ground like leaves in the wind.
  
  9. The wolf's ears cupped forward and tuned in on some distant message from the tundra. Miyax tensed and listened, too. Did he hear some brewing storm, some approaching enemy? Apparently not. His ears relaxed, and he rolled to his side. She sighed, glanced at the vaulting sky, and was painfully aware of her predicament. . . .
  
  10. It had been a frightening moment when two days ago she realized that the tundra was an ocean of grass on which she was circling around and around. Now, as that fear overcame her again, she closed her eyes. When she opened them, her heart skipped excitedly. Amaroq was looking at her!""","*Read this story. Then answer questions 22 through 28.*

2023-released-items-ela-g8,3,"""1 Slinging his light saddlebag over his shoulders and swallowing his cry of pain at the movement, he pulled his hat low over his forehead and made for the door. He needed his enlistment forms from Shulga's office; if he could find and destroy them, the army would have no record of him enlisting. Even if he did get caught after escaping—provided he escaped in the first place—there would be no proof that he was a cadet.^1 Then all he had to do was reach the stables and get Quicksilver before anyone on the dinner shift noticed what he was doing. After that . . . he would find a way out. There had to be one somewhere. . . . 
  
  2 There were no guards at the door; the barracks^2 was down to a skeleton guard for the dinner shift. Aleks silently retraced his steps from earlier in the day, making his way towards Antova's office. His eyes raced over every door's nameplate, frowning when none of them was the office he was looking for. He was incredibly short on time; he had to be on Quicksilver and heading for freedom before dinner ended. 
  
  3 Finally, he saw it. _Lt. Shulga_ was embossed on a nameplate three doors down from Antova's. Luckily, the door was unlocked and the room empty; Shulga had obviously gone straight from the time-out room to dinner. ^ e office was decorated in the same way as Antova's, in blue and dark brown, with a large map of Tellus on the wall instead of the royal crest the commander displayed. Darting across to a metal filing cabinet that took up most of one wall, Aleks wrenched open a drawer at random, ignoring the searing ache in his arms. Again, unlocked. Clearly Shulga was too cocky to think anyone would dare snoop around his office. 
  
  4 The drawer was full of neatly filed enlistment forms in alphabetical order; F-J. Aleks's form would come under V. Shutting the drawer, he reached for the next one, perplexed to find it containing M-P. The drawer after that didn't contain enlistment forms at all, but instead held a large stack of account books. Shulga didn't seem to have any sort of system whatsoever; how did he ever find anything he needed?
  
  5 Growling in frustration, Aleks began to open multiple drawers at a time, rifling through stacks of papers and leather-bound books, his desperation growing with every unsuccessful attempt. Digging through a drawer of miscellaneous files and books closest to the desk, his fingers scrabbled at the bottom of the drawer and it tilted a fraction, sending three stacked files slumping against a small metal box. ‘What the . . .' He trailed off, pressing harder on the base of the drawer, watching it dip under his fingers. The drawer had a false bottom! 
  
  6 Aleks glanced at the clock; he knew he shouldn't, but he'd always been the curious type. Emptying the drawer, he dug his nails under one side of the fake bottom, prising it up. The secret compartment was fairly narrow, containing only a thin file of papers and a battered leather journal. It was the journal that caught Aleks's eye, for it had the Anglyan crest embossed in one corner of the cover. What on Tellus was Shulga doing with an Anglyan journal? . . . 
  
  7 A door slamming somewhere in the building startled him out of his horrified trance, and a quick look at the clock nearly gave Aleks a heart attack. He barely had ten minutes until the end of dinner! 
  
  8 Stuffing the journal in an inner pocket of his coat, he hastily replaced the drawer's false bottom and contents, shutting it as quietly as he could. Tugging on the two drawers he had yet to check, he swore under his breath. Neither of them contained a V section, and Aleks felt dread creep over him at the realization that his file was likely elsewhere. He didn't have the time to search any other rooms. Out of options, he straightened up, shoving all the cabinet drawers shut and sprinting for the door. 
  
  9 A quick glance through the glass panel showed the corridor to be empty, so Aleks slipped from the room. 
  
  10 Bursting through the door of the building, he turned for the stables, slowing his pace once he hit the cobblestone path, just in case anyone happened to look his way. There was nothing more suspicious than a lone cadet running. 
  
  11 While there was supposed to be at least one stablehand in the building at all times, Aleks couldn't see a single soul in the stables. Perfect. Hurrying to the tack^3 room, he easily found Quicksilver's saddle and bridle, though carrying the heavy items in his current state nearly sent him crumpling to the floor. Still, he forced himself to ignore the pain, hefting the tack across the room towards Quicksilver's stall.
  
  12 horse whinnied when he saw the tack, knowing what it meant. Aleks shushed him, slinging the saddle on the door and slipping inside, easing the bridle on to the horse's head. Tossing the saddle on Quicksilver's back, he fastened it tightly and slung the saddlebag over the horse's rear, buckling it swiftly. He grabbed the reins, running to press Quicksilver's nose to his chest for a brief moment. ‘We need to be quiet, boy. No getting excited.'""","*Read this story. Then answer questions 29 through 35.*

2023-released-items-ela-g8,4,"""1 You're a fish in the ocean.
  
  2 It's 2023 and humans have begun deploying swarms of sentinel robot fish along the reef where you live that will monitor your environment, track pollution and collect intelligence on your behavior. Welcome to the future, my finned fishy friends.
  
  3 O.K., so you're not a fish. And this sci-fi fishland doesn't exist. But it could—not long from now.
  
  4 Allow me to introduce SoFi—like ""Sophie,"" but short for ""Soft Robotic Fish,"" revealed in Science Robotics, by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
  
  5 They explained how their finned robot was created, and how her first ocean swim on a coral reef outside of Fiji went. Robotic fish like her could be essential to understanding and protecting marine life in danger of disappearing in a fragile ocean environment, threatened by human activity and climate change.
  
  6 This foot-and-a-half long robot mimics a real fish. She can swim in the ocean at speeds up to half-its-body-length a second and at depths up to 60 feet below the surface. SoFi has a battery that will last 45 minutes before she shuts down.
  
  7 She's not quite fish flesh, but she's not a typical marine robot either. Although critical for studying the ocean, remote operated vehicles and submersibles^1 can be expensive to build and operate. They also can startle the sea creatures they're supposed to study. But without a line giving her away by connecting her to a boat, a noisy propeller or the big, rigid, awkward or angular body of a metallic land-alien, she doesn't seem to bother or scare off real fish. Some even swim along with her. Sleek, untethered, relatively inexpensive and well-tolerated, SoFi may provide biologists a fish's-eye view of animal interactions in changing marine ecosystems.
  
  8 For this group of MIT roboticists, SoFi was a dream, combining their love of diving with their work on soft robots. She was also an engineering challenge.
  
  9 SoFi started as a nine-inch silicon tail that wiggled with the assistance of a hydraulic pump.
  
  10 ""I was amazed at how well it was working, how well I was able to get this tail to beat back and forth or swim left and right, like a shark or some other fish,"" said Robert Katzschmann, a graduate student at MIT who led the team. ""But we wanted to show this wasn't just working on a test bench or table top.""
  
  11 SoFi had to swim in the ocean—at multiple depths.
  12 This meant waterproofing, buoyancy control, tweaking weight distributions and figuring out an unobtrusive^2 way to share information underwater. It also meant compact equipment.
  
  13 ""We wanted to build a fish,"" said Mr. Katzschmann. ""And the fish can't be as big as a submarine—unless we wanted to build a whale.""
  
  14 A couple years later SoFi had a finned body and head equipped with a camera, twoway hydrophone, battery, environmental sensors, operating system and communication system that allowed a diver to issue commands using a souped-up Super Nintendo controller.
  
  15 The communication system was the biggest challenge, said Mr. Katzschmann, because normally it requires a cable. Common remote signals used for piloting aerial drones don't travel below water.
  
  16 But sound waves do.
  
  17 They built their own language, sending coded messages on high-pitched sound waves between SoFi and the diver. Different bits of information were assigned their own tones, kind of like how numbers are represented by dial tones when you make a phone call. A processing system decoded and relayed the messages to tell the diver things like ""SoFi is currently swimming forward"" or command her to ""turn left, 20 degrees.""
  
  18 The high-pitched signals only travel about 65 feet and are inaudible to fish, although it's possible some whales or dolphins could hear them, which may require future research.
  
  19 ""Our primary goal was to make something for biologists,"" said Mr. Katzschmann. Heenvisions a future network of sensor-clad SoFis for studying schooling dynamics^3 or monitoring pollution over time. Currently he's working on primitive A.I. so SoFi can use her footage to identify and track real fish.
  
  20 But what if a real fish—or a shark—tracks SoFi instead? 
  
  21 ""If a shark would have come and ate our fish, that would have been the most amazing
  footage,"" Mr. Katzschmann said.""",*Read this article. Then answer questions 36 through 42.*,"*Robotic Fish to Keep a Fishy Eye on the Health of the Oceans*

2021-staar-gr3-reading-test,1,"""1 What's the first thing you think of when you hear the word ""porcupine""? Maybe it's those famous pointy quills. A porcupine has 30,000 or more of them! 
 
 2 You might have seen cartoons showing porcupines that could ""shoot"" their quills. Real porcupines can't do that. But if a predator attacks a porcupine, the animal whirls around with its sharp quills raised. It swishes its tail from side to side. And if the attacker gets whacked, the quills will easily get stuck in its skin.
 
 *On the Menu*
 
 3 The name porcupine means ""quill pig."" The quill part is right, but porcupines aren't pigs at all. Like mice, squirrels, and beavers, they're rodents. North American porcupines live in much of the United States and Canada.
 
 4 Porcupines are out and about both day and night, though more at night. They don't hibernate, so during different times of the year different things are on a porcupine's menu. In the spring, for example, they <ul>nibble</ul> on buds, flowers, leaves, and more. During winter, there's less to eat, so porcupines live mostly on bark and evergreen needles then.
 
 5 Porcupines have long, orange front teeth that never stop growing. But that's OK, because porcupines hardly ever stop gnawing! That keeps their teeth worn down. Besides chewing their normal food, they'll also gnaw at things such as picnic tables, rake handles, cabins, and even shoes!
 
 *Little Pricklies*
 
 6 In the spring, a mother porcupine gives birth to one baby. Some newborn animals are helpless, but not baby porcupines. They're born with their eyes open and are able to walk right away.
 
 7 At first, their quills are soft and wet. But in just a few hours, the quills dry out and become stiff little stabbers. They aren't long enough to hurt a predator, though. So if a baby feels threatened, it quickly finds a place to hide.
 
 8 A baby porcupine nurses from its mom for about four months. But it also begins eating soft plant parts when it's just a few days old. After it stops nursing, a young porcupine will separate from its mom for longer and longer periods, until it's ready to live on its own.
 
 *At Home up a Tree*
 
 9 Porcupines are great climbers and spend a lot of their time in trees. Long claws and rough paw pads help them get a grip. When they're just a few weeks old, even babies can climb young, skinny trees. Climbing can be a good way to help porcupines avoid enemies. 
 
 10 Speaking of enemies, porcupines don't have very many. Only a few kinds of animals know how to get around a porcupine's prickly defenses. Some predators of porcupines include cougars, wolves, and bears.
 
 *Super Quills*
 
 11 Most animals, though, won't mess with a porcupine. Its quills are amazing weapons. They're on every part of the animal's body except for its belly, face, and ears. But most are on the porcupine's back and tail. Quills are actually sharp, stiff hairs. And some of them can be up to four inches long! 
 
 12 The tips of the quills are covered with tiny hook-like barbs. The barbs make the quills very hard to pull out. And the ends of the quills are covered with greasy stuff that makes it easier for them to keep moving in deeper. As they do, they can cause more problems inside a victim's body. 
 
 13 An animal brave (or foolish) enough to attack a porcupine does get some warning. When a porcupine feels threatened, it clacks its teeth together. Then it lets off a strong warning smell as it raises its quills. If that doesn't work, the porcupine whirls around, swishing its prickly tail back and forth. Some animals might give up at this point and go find an easier meal. But if an animal does attack, it will end up with a face or foot full of sharp quills. _Yow!_
 
 14 Porcupines have one of the best self-defense systems in nature. These walking pincushions sure can take care of themselves!""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in the answer on your answer document.*,"*Prickly Porcupines*

2021-staar-gr3-reading-test,2,"""1 Layla knew the grin on her face stretched from ear to ear. She just couldn't help it. Was there anything better than spending a school day exploring a national park? Layla didn't think so. She loved being outside because there was always something new to discover. This was only the second field trip she had ever been on, but Layla was certain this would be the best one of her school career. 
 
 2 The group's hike had just begun, yet Layla had already seen and learned about many interesting things. She listened carefully as the tour guide pointed to a plant covered with tiny yellow flowers. The guide explained that butterflies loved this native Texas plant called lantana. Then she gathered the group to move ahead. 
 
 3 As Layla got close to the lantana, she couldn't believe her luck. A beautiful orange butterfly with black and white spots had landed on one of the tiny yellow flowers. Layla quickly grabbed her camera and snapped a picture. As she tucked her camera back in her backpack, something on the trail caught her eye. Layla picked up the object. It looked like a rock that had been broken in half. When she turned it over in her hand, Layla gasped in surprise. She could see that the rock was not solid all the way through. Along the inside wall of the hollow rock were tiny, beautiful crystals. 
 
 4 Layla gazed at the little twinkling gift tucked inside the rock. She was so absorbed in her discovery that she did not hear her classmate Cooper walking behind her. Cooper leaned over Layla's shoulder and said, ""You found a geode? Cool!"" 
 
 5 Layla jumped. ""A what?"" she asked. 
 
 6 ""A geode. It's a kind of rock with crystals inside. That's a nice one. Quick! Hide it before the tour guide sees it.""
 
 7 Layla quickly shoved it into the pocket of her jacket. Then she turned, looking over her shoulder to see where the tour guide was. She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the guide far down the trail with the rest of the group. 
 
 8 ""I'm not sure I should keep it,"" Layla said. ""The tour guide might like to see it and tell us what she knows about it. Besides, don't you remember what she told us?"" 
 
 9 Cooper rolled his eyes. ""Yeah, yeah. ‘Take only pictures. Leave only footprints.' But there are probably a million of those rocks lying around in this area. Do you really think they are going to miss this one rock? You know what I think? It will make an awesome souvenir."" With that, Cooper jogged down the trail to catch up with the rest of the class. 
 
 10 Layla bit her lip uncertainly as her fingers touched the rock inside her pocket. ""It would give me something to help me remember the trip,"" she thought. But Layla could not ignore the heavy feeling that had settled in her heart. 
 
 11 _Take only pictures. Leave only footprints_. The tour guide's words played over and over in Layla's mind.
 
 12 As she stood on the edge of the trail, Layla suddenly noticed the cool breeze, and it comforted her. The sweet scent of the honeysuckle blossoms brought a smile to her face. The songs of nearby birds seemed to speak to her and tell her what she should do. 
 
 13 Carefully, Layla removed the geode from her pocket. As she held it, she felt the heaviness lift from inside her. She smiled when the sunlight bounced off the crystals, sending the rays in a thousand directions at once. ""You sure are pretty,"" she murmured. 
 
 14 She was still smiling as she looked ahead at her classmates, who were down the trail with the tour guide. As she started to jog toward them, Layla <ul>cradled<ul> the geode gently in her hands.

2021-staar-gr3-reading-test,3,"""1 Many animals are superstars in their own ways. Some can jump very far. Others can run very fast. But one animal is a superstar for being s-l-o-w. The sloth is the slowest mammal on Earth. The sloth may seem like it is just lazy. But as scientists are discovering, this cute animal may actually be super smart. Its slow movements help make it go <ul>unnoticed<ul> by its enemies.
 
 2 You might think it would be easy to learn about slow animals. If they cannot move fast, it must be easy to watch them. But sloths spend most of their time hanging upside down in trees. Because of this, scientists cannot see the sloths or follow them easily. Even today these animals are very mysterious. One thing that scientists do know is that sloths are very different from most other animals.
 
 *Sloth Style*
 
 3 Sloths have longer arms than legs with M<ul>curved<ul> claws on each hand and foot. The claws help these animals hang upside down. Their bodies are covered with long, gray-brown fur. Algae, which is plantlike matter that can grow on pond water, grow on their fur. This makes the sloths look green. Up in the tree, the colors and shape of the sloth blend in with the tree. If you were to stare at the sloth, you might think it was a branch.
 
 4 With gentle brown eyes and a flat little nose, the sloth might win the award for cutest animal. Its lips are always turned up as though it is smiling. Its mouth holds only 18 teeth, and its ears are very small. Sloths grow to be only about 25 inches long—around the size of a human baby.
 
 *Slow Movers*
 
 5 When sloths are awake, they move very slowly. They spend most of their time in trees. In fact, the animals come down only about once a week. While sloths are good climbers, they are not good walkers. Their back legs are weak. To walk the sloths must drag themselves using their front claws. Sloths are excellent swimmers. Sometimes they fall straight from their trees into rivers and go for a swim.
 
 6 Most of the time sloths are sleeping. They snooze between 15 and 20 hours each day. Then, at night sloths wake up to eat.
 
 7 Scientists are still learning about what sloths eat. They are known to eat twigs, leaves, and fruit. They get most of their water from the juicier parts of their food. Because sloths do not move much, they do not need to eat much. They also need to go to the bathroom only once a week. For this, they slowly climb down from their homes in the trees.
 
 *Staying Safe*
 
 8 Whether in trees or on the ground, sloths face dangers. The greatest danger comes from predators like jaguars, large birds, and snakes. It is difficult for a sloth to defend itself. 
 
 9 Sloths face other challenges too. The animals live high in the rain forest. When parts of the rain forest are cut down, sloths lose their homes. Fortunately, places like the Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica help sloths when they are in trouble.
 
 *Helping Sloths*
 
 10 The Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica cares very much about sloths. The people there provide a home for sick or hurt sloths. The workers nurse them back to health. Then, they return them to the rain forest.
 
 11 A scientist named Becky Cliffe works with the Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica to care for the sloths. Cliffe studies sloths and wants to learn more about their habits. She found a new way to study sloths in the wild by using a special sloth backpack. The tiny backpack contains a camera and a GPS tracker. The backpack records the sloth's location and takes photographs. It allows Cliffe to collect a huge amount of important information about the daily life of a sloth.
 
 12 Cliffe plans to keep studying sloths. ""There is still so much we need to know about them,"" she says. By learning more, scientists may be able to keep these slow superstars safe for years to come.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2021-staar-gr3-reading-test,5,"""1 In 1900 a scientist named Frederick Starr was exploring a mountain in Mexico. Suddenly he heard soft pounding sounds. He listened carefully and followed the sounds coming through the trees. The sounds grew louder. Soon Starr came to a village. There he found something very interesting. The pounding came from people hitting rocks on bark. They were making paper that would be used to create art. Other scientists had thought people no longer knew how to make bark paper, but Starr found out differently. The villagers were making a very special kind of paper—_amate_ (ah-MAH-tay).
 
 2 Starr made his discovery more than 100 years ago. Since then scientists have learned much more about amate. The people of Mexico have been making this beautiful paper for hundreds of years.
 
 *Bark Paintings Now and Then*
 
 3 Today the paper is still handmade by people in Mexican villages. The paper is decorated with colorful paints to make paintings that might show interesting scenes from village life. Or the paintings might be pictures from nature. Rainbow-colored birds, animals, or flowers are common. These paintings are often used as decorations in homes.
 
 4 Amate paintings are popular in Mexico and around the world. Many visitors buy these special works of art. People appreciate having a piece of this important part of Mexican history.
 
 5 Long ago bark paper had another purpose. It was used for books. The bark paper was folded into a book with several pages. Then small pictures were painted on the pages. These paintings tell stories of the past. They also give helpful information. For example, they show us how people made different medicines.
 
 6 Many of these books were lost over time. Scientists treasure the books that are left. They are important because they tell what life in Mexico was like long ago.
 
 *Making Bark Paper*
 
 7 Amate is made from the bark of mulberry or fig trees. The mulberry bark makes light-colored paper, while the fig bark makes dark-colored paper. 
 
 8 The bark is stripped from the trees. Then it is washed. Next the bark is boiled in a pot of water and ashes for hours until it breaks apart into strips. 
 
 9 The strips of bark are placed on a flat, wooden drying board. Some strips are placed across in rows, while other strips are placed from top to bottom. Any long ends of the bark are cut off so that they do not hang over the edges of the board. After that the strips are flattened with rocks. Soon there is just one flat rectangle of paper. This paper is left to dry in the sun. 
 
 10 When the paper is dry, it is ready to paint. The artists make outlines of their drawings using black paint. Then they fill in the shapes with bright colors. Now the painted bark paper is ready to display and enjoy. 
 
 11 Amate has been around for hundreds of years, but it is still important today. This beautiful handmade paper teaches us much about Mexico and its people.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2021-staar-gr4-reading-test-tagged,1,"""1 Super-smart and super-social, elephants have a lot to say—and many different ways of saying it. 
 
 *Sound*
 
 2 You may think you know how _elephants_ communicate: With trunks held high, they blast the air with loud trumpeting sounds. But that's not the only way elephants make themselves heard within the herd. These massive mammals have a vocabulary to match their size: more than 70 different vocal sounds, from barks to snorts to cries. 
 
 3 Elephants make rumbles—deep, vibrating noises—more often than they do any other sound. An elephant makes its rumble the same way a person speaks: with its _larynx_ (LAIR-inks, ""voice box""). But an elephant's huge larynx produces very low sounds. In fact, some rumbles are too low for human ears to hear. A person standing nearby may feel the vibrations. But elephants can pick up these rumbles from miles away! They use special sensors in their feet to ""hear"" the distant vibrations through the ground. 
 
 *Body Language*
 
 4 An elephant can also say a lot without making a sound. All it needs to do is strike a pose. Some gestures—a twitch of an ear, a wag of the head—are so small that most people wouldn't even notice them. But scientists who study elephants have discovered that even when the animals are silent, they are using their bodies to ""chat."" For example, that ear twitch may mean ""I'm done here—let's go."" And the head wag may translate as ""Let's play!""
 
 5 Some elephant ""sign language"" is easier to translate. A happy elephant will flap both ears and wag its tail. Faced with a threat, an elephant will flare its ears and stick its tail out straight. Sometimes, a whole herd gets spooked. All the elephants stand perfectly still, holding their trunks high in the air or draping them on the ground. Scientists call this ""synchronized freezing."" They think it may help the elephants focus all their attention on the sounds and smells around them.
 
 *Smell*
 
 6 If you ever wonder what an elephant is paying attention to, don't watch its eyes. Watch its trunk! The big body may look still. But the tip of that super-sensitive smeller is always on the move, sniffing out the answers to some important questions: _What did my friend eat for breakfast? Who's been to this watering hole recently? Are there any predators nearby?_
 
 7 Many of those answers can be found in smelly ""messages"" left behind by other elephants.
 
 *Touch*
 
 8 When human toddlers feel tired or sad, they may head for the comfort of a parent's lap. Elephant calves do something similar. Worn out from playing or stressed by an _unfamiliar_ situation, a calf will tuck itself under Mom's big, sheltering body. (Elephants don't have laps!) That lets Mom know that her baby needs extra attention.
 
 9 Throughout a herd, touching helps create bonds of family and friendship. One female may pat another with her trunk: ""How's it going?"" A male may twist his trunk around a female's: ""I like you!"" Or one elephant may use its trunk to shove another: ""Back off! You're getting on my nerves."" Who needs words when you have a trunk?""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in the answer on your answer document.*,"*Big Talkers*

 *BELLA* : A nine-year-old girl 
 *SCOTT* : Bella's best friend 
 *AMY* : Bella's classmate 
 *MOM* : Bella's mother 
 *SAMANTHA* : Bella's six-year-old sister 
 
 *SCENE 1*
 
 1 [ _The scene opens in the school cafeteria. Bella, Scott, and Amy are eating lunch with their classmates_. ]
 
 2 *BELLA* : I'm nervous about the spelling test this afternoon. 
 
 3 *SCOTT* : Don't be, Bella. Remember what I told you? When you hear a word that ends with the ""shun"" sound, you just have to write t-i-o-n at the end of it. 
 
 4 *BELLA* : [ _Glumly._ ] You make it sound so easy. 
 [ _Bella is silent for a moment, and then she begins rapping._ ]
  I studied for this test like I had a fascination 
 No hesitation 
 Like my life wouldn't go on without this ""shun"" sensation! 
 But now I'm getting nervous... about my limitation. 
 I try to pay attention! But then it feels like my brain just loses its retention. 
 Oh yeah, and did I mention 
 That an every-Friday spelling test was NOT a great invention?
 5 [ _Laughter is heard. As Bella, Scott, and Amy stand up and gather their belongings, Amy stops Bella_. ]
 
 6 *AMY* : Can I ask you something? [ _Bella nods._ ] Why do you always rap in front of everybody? I sing in the shower sometimes, but I don't think I would sing while everyone is eating their lunch.
 
 7 *BELLA* : What do you mean? 
 
 8 *AMY* : Well, I would be embarrassed if everyone were laughing at me. 
 
 9 *BELLA* : Really?
 
 10 *AMY* : Look, if you had a piece of food stuck in your teeth, I would let you know. So I'm going to tell you that you sound pretty silly when you rap
 
 11 [ _Amy pats Bella on the shoulder and walks away. Bella sits and slumps into her chair_. ]
 
 *SCENE 2*
 
 12 [ _School hallway, one week later. Bella stands at her locker. Scott arrives and looks at the paper she is holding_. ]
 
 13 *SCOTT* : From what I can see, ""shun"" words aren't easy for you. If you like, I can help you study to retake the test on Wednesday. 
 
 14 *BELLA* : I don't think it'll help. I already studied for this test. 
 
 15 *SCOTT* : It's O.K. You'll get it. Besides, you're _really_ good at lots of other stuff. Seriously, how many people can put together rhymes on the spot like you? 
 
 16 *BELLA* : Well, I never meant to look foolish. Why didn't you tell me that everyone's been laughing at me? 
 
 17 *SCOTT* : Aren't you _trying_ to make us laugh? 
 
 18 *BELLA* : Yeah, but I want people to laugh because I'm funny. Not because I'm embarrassing myself. 
 
 19 *SCOTT* : You _are_ funny. 
 
 20 *BELLA* : Amy thinks I sound silly. 
 
 21 *SCOTT* : Amy just wishes _she_ could make everybody laugh. Listen, you have the gift of rhyme. You should just keep on rapping. 
 
 22 *BELLA:* [ _Shrugs_. ] We'll see.
 
 *SCENE 3*
 23 [ _Late afternoon, the same day. Bella sits in her living room. Mom enters and picks up a paper._ ]
 
 24 *MOM* : I guess we should've spent more time studying the ""shun"" words. 
 
 25 *BELLA* : I'm going to try again on Wednesday. 
 
 26 *MOM* : Are you worrying about these spelling tests?
 
 27 *BELLA* : They're really hard. And I'm used to making good grades. 
 
 28 *MOM* : I understand, Bella. But you can't <u>excel<u> at _everything._
 
 29 [ _Samantha enters, holding a car she built with building blocks._ ]
 
 30 *SAMANTHA* : [ _With beat and attitude._ ]
 I built a cool car! 
 I've got snails in a jar! 
 And beside my bed 
 Is a book I have read!
 
 31 *BELLA* : [ _Stunned._ ] Did she just rap? 
 
 32 *MOM* : Yes. She raps all the time. She wants to be like her big sister. 
 
 33 *BELLA* : [ _Looks at Samantha._ ] Well, I'm probably not ever going to be a renowned rapper. 
 
 34 *MOM* : Bella, your sister is not hoping you'll be famous. She just thinks it's cool when you rhyme, and she wants to do it, too. It's good for her to see how quickly you create a rap. [ _Mom turns to Samantha._ ] Let's clean up before dinner.
 
 35 [ _Mom and Samantha pick up toys. Bella watches them, deep in thought. After a few minutes she stands in front of Mom and Samantha._ ]
 
 36 *BELLA* : So my little sister Sammy seems to have a gift like me. She can put the words together like a bumble and a bee. I have always liked rapping. I really don't know why. There is nothing I like more than making rhymes on the fly. Yes, it's hard sometimes, to go out on a limb And share secret thoughts with your family and friends. But I'm realizing now, if I let folks bring me down, I'll be teaching little Sammy to let her passions drown.

2021-staar-gr4-reading-test-tagged,3,"""1 One day 11-year-old Cassidy Goldstein was trying to work on an art project. She noticed that all of her crayons were broken. Cassidy searched for a way to save the small stubs of the crayons. She wanted to use every last stroke of color in each little crayon. She didn't like to be wasteful. ""I wanted to find something that would hold the crayon in place and extend it,"" said Cassidy. Then Cassidy found some plastic tubes used to hold single-cut flowers. And she had an idea. The tubes were just the right size to hold her broken crayons. She would make her own crayon holders.
 
 2 Cassidy gathered the tubes, popped her crayons inside, and began to draw. The ends of the tubes fit tightly around the crayons. Each tube was long enough to hold one full-size unbroken crayon. It could also hold a small broken one. The crayon holders worked so well that she thought other kids would want to use them too.
 
 3 Cassidy knew that her invention would make many young artists happy. With her father's help, she worked hard to get her product on the shelves of stores. Cassidy met with a group of lawyers who help inventors get patents^1. First the lawyers discovered that no one had made anything like Cassidy's product before. Then they helped her get a patent for her crayon holder. Next the lawyers helped her find a company that could make and sell the product. Soon people could buy crayon holders online and in stores. Eventually so many crayon holders were sold that Cassidy was able to pay for most of her college education out of her earnings.
 
 4 Thanks to Cassidy's crayon holders, using every bit of a crayon is much easier than it used to be. Cassidy's invention encourages others to waste less. It also inspires others to think of clever ways to use what they've got. Cassidy's invention is a brilliant idea. It is a perfect solution for a broken-crayon problem.""",*Read the next two selections.

2021-staar-gr4-reading-test-tagged,4,""" 1 The 2000 Olympic Games started in Sydney, Australia. At the center stage was a trampoline. The first Olympic trampoline event was about to start, and 86-year-old George Nissen sat in the audience. He was waiting to see his lifetime goal spring into action. Nissen was only a teenager when he invented the trampoline, but he had always hoped to see it used in the Olympics.
 
 2 Many years earlier George Nissen was a gymnast and a diver in high school. He was very interested in being healthy and strong too. One day at a circus, he saw trapeze artists flipping through the air and bouncing off the safety nets below. 
 
 3 Nissen was interested in the nets. He thought that bouncing on a net could help improve his tumbling and diving. So, in his garage, Nissen tied heavy canvas to a steel frame. It worked, but his bouncer wasn't as springy as he wanted it to be. Nissen continued _refining_ it. He wanted it to be just right so he could work on his sports skills. 
 
 4 In 1934 Nissen went to college. He continued to think about the bouncer. Nissen decided to use strips of rubber to connect the canvas to the frame. Now he had a bouncer he could _really_ jump on. 
 
 5 Nissen took his bouncer to a swimming camp. The swimmers and divers enjoyed jumping on the bouncer so much that they didn't even want to swim. From then on they used the bouncer to practice and improve their twists and flips in the air. 
 
 6 After college Nissen joined a tumbling group that used the bouncer for performing. People were amazed by how high the group could jump and flip.
 
 7 Soon after, Nissen named his bouncer ""trampoline."" The name is from the Spanish word _trampolín_, which means ""diving board."" Nissen opened a store and sold trampolines. People were excited to try them. People also thought of other ways trampolines could be used. People jumped on them for exercise, and the military used trampolines to help pilots adapt to being in the air.
 
 8 Today kids and adults jump on trampolines in gyms and backyards to stay active and healthy. Nissen's invention not only added variety to the Olympics, it also provided a fun way for many people to stay fit.""",,*Bouncing Around*,,,,,,,,,,"2000 Summer Olympics T

2021-staar-gr4-reading-test-tagged,6,"""1 When I walked into the kitchen, I decided to think of it as my lab. The stove was a giant Bunsen burner, and the pots and pans were beakers and flasks. _If only I had a lab coat_, I thought, and then I had a brilliant idea. I ran upstairs and grabbed one of Lyle's white work shirts. It was long enough on me to look like a coat. I looked like a genius scientist. 
 
 2 Next, I needed a plan. I read the instructions on the pasta box, which said that I should boil the spaghetti for ten to twelve minutes. I checked out the serving size, which was two ounces. Since I was going to make two pounds of spaghetti so we could have leftovers the next night, I calculated I should boil the pasta for four times as long: forty to forty-eight minutes. 
 
 3 Easy peasy. 
 
 4 I got out a big pot from the cabinet, filled it up with water, and then put it on the burner. Here's where I ran into my first problem. 
 
 5 I'm not allowed to use the stove. 
 
 6 ""Hey, Sarah!"" I called. ""How am I supposed to cook dinner if turning on the stove is against the rules?""
 
 7 Sarah came in from the living room. ""Do you know how to turn it on?"" 
 
 8 I felt my face turn red. ""Uh, not really."" 
 
 9 ""No need to be embarrassed, little buddy,"" Sarah said, patting me on the shoulder, which made me feel even more embarrassed. ""There's a first time for everything.""
 
 10 Then she showed me what I needed to do. 
 
 11 The instructions on the pasta box said I had to let the water come to a boil before I put the spaghetti in the pot. I didn't know how long that would take, so I thought I'd go ahead and pour the sauce into another pan and start heating that up. Which is where I ran into my second problem. 
 
 12 I couldn't get the lid off the jar. 
 
 13 ""Like I said, there's a first time for everything, right?"" Sarah said, patting me on the back again. ""The trick to this is use a rubber glove."" 
 
 14 Sarah wrapped the lid with one of the yellow rubber gloves by the sink, took a deep breath, and twisted. The top popped off. 
 
 15 ""Know why the jar makes that popping sound when it comes off?"" Sarah asked. 
 
 16 ""Um, I'm not sure,"" I said, my face getting even redder. I was starting to feel like a total failure in the lab. ""Maybe it's gas that's being released from the jar?"" 
 
 17 Sarah nodded. ""That sounds like a good explanation. Hey, do you know how to turn on the oven? You need to start preheating it for the garlic bread."" 
 
 18 That, I did know. 
 
 19 Five minutes later I had the sauce heating up in a pot, the garlic bread unwrapped and on a baking tray, and the box of spaghetti ready to dump in the water. 
 
 20 I also had six spaghetti sauce stains on Lyle's shirt, but I was pretty sure they'd wash out.
 
 21 I dumped the spaghetti into the pot. All two pounds of it. 
 
 22 That might not have been the greatest idea in the world. 
 
 23 After dinner was over, I decided to write a lab report, which is what scientists do, whether their experiments are successful or not.

2021-staar-gr5-reading-test-tagged,1,"""1 Catalina stood on the doorstep of the Cerro Tololo observatory staff housing, drinking in deep lungfuls of the clear night air under the blazing Southern Hemisphere starshine. The Milky Way sprawled across the sky, a swath of pure white lace shadowed by dark blotches. 
 
 2 Night was her favorite time. During the day the Chilean mountaintop swarmed with tourists, shouting and calling to each other as breezes spun dust into the thin mountain air. While the visitors were there, Papá could not allow her to help. 
 
 3 But at night, when everything was quiet, Catalina was one of the few who were allowed beyond the roped-off corridors and the ""No Admittance"" signs. The night staff all knew her. 
 
 4 She loved helping to service the grand telescopes, the eyes that peered out into the universe—even if it was annoying how she was always told not to disturb the astronomers who directed the telescopes through the night. Catalina wanted more than anything to confess her secret dream to these great and revered scientists.
 
 5 When she said, ""Papá, I want to be an astronomer someday,"" he laughed and tugged at one of her long black braids. 
 
 6 But Catalina was curious. The sky did not merely consist of white dots of stars against a black background. The sky she saw every night was knotted with patterns, from fuzzy balls of fluff to filaments. 
 
 7 No one believed she would be a scientist one day. But why? She knew she could be a good scientist. She knew it! 
 
 8 She danced along the dirt road, bare feet soundless against the gravel, a practiced eye scanning the half-dozen domes at the mountaintop's summit. Then she stopped suddenly. The one-meter telescope's dome slit was open, but its angle was unusual. Cautiously, she wandered nearer. The telescope was pointed down, almost at the ground, lower than she had ever seen it. 
 
 9 She bit her lip, shifting from foot to foot. The red light over the entrance door indicated that it was forbidden to enter and disturb the scientists at work. 
 
 10 Something was wrong, she was sure of it. 
 
 11 So, taking a deep breath, she turned the handle and slipped inside. 
 
 12 She took a cautious step forward and saw an irregular shape hunched on the floor. 
 
 13 She inhaled sharply. It was a man. Coming closer, she saw that one leg was bent under him at an awkward angle. 
 
 14 ""_Señor_?"" she whispered. ""Are you all right?"" 
 
 15 The man groaned. ""Fell,"" he gasped in his accented Spanish, gesturing at the platform above. ""I think... broke leg."" 
 
 16 Catalina balanced on the balls of her feet. ""I'll run and get the night operator,"" she promised, already backing toward the door. 
 
 17 ""No!"" His voice was sharp. ""First, need to . . . fix the telescope."" 
 
 18 Catalina's eyes lifted to the clock drive lit by a blinking yellow light. She had often helped her father reset this device. Quickly, she walked to the controller and flipped the two switches her father used to stop the telescope.
 
 19 The man behind her was gasping out directions. 
 
 20 ""Shh, it's all right,"" she soothed, coming to his side. ""I fixed it. No more problems, OK?""
 
 21 ""You what . . . ?"" he muttered, confused. ""Already?"" Then his head lolled to one side. Catalina jumped to her feet. 
 
 22 Her braids thumped her back rhythmically as she ran all the way to the night operator's office. 
 
 23 _""Señor_ Rojas, there's an emergency,"" she called out as the big man swiveled his beat-up wooden chair to face her. ""The astronomer using the one-meter had an accident. He fell and broke his leg. You need to get help!"" 
 
 24 Later that night, Catalina crouched behind one of the junction boxes as the astronomer was carried out on a stretcher. 
 
 25 ""Wait!"" he called as he was about to be loaded into the ambulance. ""Wait! Catalina! How did you know?"" he asked. 
 
 26 ""Know what?"" she whispered, puzzled. 
 
 27 ""That something was wrong."" 
 
 28 She scuffed the dirt with her toe. ""Um, I saw the barrel pointing down, and I knew . . . it wasn't normal."" 
 
 29 His eyes sharpened. ""That was observant of you."" 
 
 30 Shyly, she nodded. 
 
 31 His gaze remained on her as they lifted the stretcher and began to slide it into the ambulance. ""A good scientist,"" he continued, ""is always observant."" 
 
 32 That night, when she ran out under the stars, she called, ""I'll discover all your secrets someday!"" Circling above her, the intricate sky no longer seemed quite so remote.""","*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in the answer on your answer document.*

All you need is the perfect place to start reading. When you walk into the backyard, you see it. The hammock hanging between the two oak trees is exactly what you had in mind.
 
 2 People have been using hammocks for many years. The first people to create these swinging cots are the Taino. They are people native to the Caribbean and to Central and South America. The Taino made the hammocks by weaving together cotton, plant fibers, and tree bark. The word ""hammock"" comes from the Spanish word _hamaca_. Hammocks were likely named after the bark from the hamack tree from which they were first created. 
 
 3 European explorers came in search of the New World many years after the Taino had begun making hammocks. The explorers were impressed with the unique beds. Christopher Columbus <u>spotted<u> hammocks in the Caribbean in 1492. They made such an impact on him that he wrote about hammocks in his journals. Columbus admired how the hanging beds kept sleepers safe from the soggy ground and pesky forest animals. These portable beds were also easily moved. They were small enough when folded that they could fit in small spaces on ships. Columbus tested a hammock and found it to be comfortable and cool. 
 
 4 Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés was another explorer who was fascinated by hammocks. He arrived on the island of Hispaniola in 1514. He drew a picture of the knitted cotton rugs that natives hung between trees using twine strings. ""Since the weather is warm, they require no covers at all,"" Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés later wrote about his findings. 
 
 5 By the middle of the 16th century, more sailors became interested in hammocks. These sailors used them on naval and merchant ships. The sailors made their hammocks out of sturdy canvas. However, this adapted version lacked the airflow of the woven versions and made sleeping in the heat below deck uncomfortable for the sailors.
 
 6 Hammocks were soon exposed to the rest of the world. In 1889 a South Carolina riverboat captain named Joshua John Ward crafted a different type of hammock. He was interested in creating cool beds for his riverboat. He created hammocks out of cotton rope. His company still makes hammocks using the same materials.
 
 7 Today hammocks are not just for relaxing. They are now part of a thrill-seeking sport known as extreme hammocking. In extreme hammocking athletes may string a hammock between large rocks. Some athletes hang the hammocks from the bottom of a bridge. Others might stack their hammocks between two trees. Athletes climb to their destination by using strong straps and special shoes. Wherever the location hammockers enjoy the challenges the climb brings. Andy Lewis, an extreme-hammocking expert from Utah, said, ""The experience speaks for itself. The joy is in the journey, rather than the destination.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

 2 Heaving a sigh of relief, I sat down on my special rock. In the distance I could see our house, but I knew that no one would know where to look for me. At last I had peace and quiet. 
 
 3 I lifted my guitar onto my knee and pressed my fingers onto the strings. I strummed and started to sing, ""Lean on me, when you're not strong . . ."" I moved my fingers to try to find the next chord and strummed again. 
 
 4 ""Ugh, that sounds terrible,"" I mumbled. 
 
 5 I played the first chord and sang again, ""Lean on me . . ."" I grimaced in frustration when I struck the wrong chord. ""Why can't I get this song right?"" I wondered aloud. 
 
 6 ""How's it going, Desha?"" 
 
 7 Startled, I glanced over my shoulder and saw my brother James standing there. 
 
 8 ""Don't you have a basketball game to watch?"" I complained. So much for my perfect hideaway. 
 
 9 ""The game was almost over when I noticed you left. I thought you might like some company."" 
 
 10 ""Company is the last thing I want. Can't I have a little peace and quiet? I left the house to escape you guys."" I felt my throat tightening up. 
 
 11 James studied me for a moment. ""It's tough having such a big family, isn't it?"" 
 
 12 ""Everyone's so nosy and always <u>prying<u> into my business. Yesterday I found Eliza looking through my journal, and now everyone is in the living room watching the game. All I wanted to do was watch a movie, but when I went to my room, Sara was there listening to the radio. I just want to be alone for a change."" 
 
 13 James sighed as he sat on a rock.
 
 14 ""I felt the same way when I was your age,"" he said. ""But now . . ."" 
 
 15 ""Now you have your own room."" A trace of bitterness crept into my voice. ""Once Daniel went off to college, you didn't have to share anymore."" 
 
 16 James chuckled. ""It is great to have my own room, but sometimes I really miss Daniel. We used to talk about everything at night—sports, school, friends, you name it. As crowded as it seemed at times, it was actually kind of comforting to have someone else there."" 
 
 17 ""Yeah, ‘crowded' is right."" I couldn't help but grin. ""We are stuffed like feathers in a pillow in that house."" 
 
 18 ""I know,"" James said, laughing. ""But there are some good things that come out of it—we share memories and jokes no one else understands, and when things get tough, we can always count on one another for support."" 
 
 19 I sighed, running my hand along my guitar. 
 
 20 ""Didn't Sara stay up half the night with you last week helping you with your homework?"" James asked. 
 
 21 I shrugged and admitted unwillingly, ""Yeah, sometimes she can be all right.""

 23 ""Doesn't matter. It seems anyone can find it,"" I said. 
 
 24 ""Only if you know where to look,"" James replied, patting the rock he was sitting on. ""I've known about it for a while."" 
 
 25 I looked to the side of James's knee and saw the initials J.D.P. etched into the stone. ""James Dawson Pruitt,"" I said.
 
 26 James smiled. ""This is a great spot for getting away. Now, how about that guitar chord you were trying to find?"" 
 
 27 ""You know guitar chords?"" I raised my eyebrows. 
 
 28 ""Sure, I played some guitar before I went for the drums,"" James said. ""I still remember the basics. Here, let me try."" 
 
 29 I hesitated for a moment, and when I handed my brother the guitar, I thought, ""Maybe family isn't so bad after all.""",*Read the next two selections. Then choose the best answer to each question.*,*Peace and Quiet*,,,,,,,,,,"

2021-staar-gr5-reading-test-tagged,5,"""1 In Australia there is a small, furry, brown animal that lives in lakes, rivers, and streams. It looks a bit like an otter but appears to have a duck's bill and a beaver's tail. When it walks on land, it waddles from side to side like a large lizard. The platypus is so odd looking that the first time English scientists saw it, they thought someone was playing a trick on them.
 
 *The Female Platypus*
 
 2 Scientists have since learned that in addition to its mixed-up looks, the platypus has some mixed-up behaviors. One of the oddest things about the platypus is that it hatches its young from leathery eggs. This is strange because scientists consider the platypus a mammal. 
 
 3 Scientists are interested in what a particular kind of animal has in common with other animals. Animals in the mammal group are warm blooded and have hair or fur. Female mammals produce milk for their babies. In addition, they give birth to live young rather than hatching their young from eggs. 
 
 4 The platypus breaks this rule. It is one of only two mammals that lay eggs. When a female platypus is ready to have babies, she uses her sharp claws to dig a hole in the bank of a river or stream. The hole is called a burrow. The female takes grass and leaves into the burrow and makes a nest where she lays her eggs. The platypus's eggs are tough like a reptile's, rather than brittle like a bird's. The female platypus keeps the eggs warm for about 10 days until they hatch.
 
 5 The newly hatched platypuses are about the size of a lima bean. The mother and her babies live in the burrow until the young are strong enough to leave. When platypuses grow up, they go off on their own. This animal <u>prefers<u> living alone rather than living in a group.
 
 *The Male Platypus*
 
 6 Female platypuses are not the only ones to have an interesting characteristic rarely found in mammals. Male platypuses have a sharp bone on their hind leg called a spur. 
 
 7 The male platypuses use their spurs to defend themselves from hungry foxes, dogs, and water snakes. They may also use the spurs on each other while fighting over female platypuses. The male platypuses can use their spurs to cause other animals a great deal of pain.
 
 *A Special Way to Find Food*
 
 8 Platypuses do not spend much time walking. When they are not curled up in their burrows, they are usually swimming. They spend nearly half the day in water hunting for food. They can eat an amount equal to 20 percent of their own body weight every day. 
 
 9 Platypuses eat tiny water creatures, including young insects, worms, and shrimp. They may also eat small frogs or fish. Most of their tiny prey is hidden in the dark sand at the bottom of a lake or river. Platypuses close their eyes and ears when they dive, so they must use special sensitive cells on their bills that tell them where to find a meal. 
 
 10 Platypuses may have some of the features of animals in other classes, but clearly, this mammal is unique and fascinating.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2021-staar-gr5-reading-test-tagged,6,"""1 Before January 2005, young girls couldn't play soccer in Katutura, a black township in Namibia, Africa. They had no soccer balls, no playing field, no shoes, and no leader. Each day, girls and boys gathered at the Nordkamp Center, an after-school drop-in center, for soup. Then most of the boys would leave to play soccer in a nearby dirt field while the girls remained at the center to jump rope, braid hair, or read books. 
 
 2 Center counselor Mary Beth Gallagher loved soccer and knew that the girls would love it, too. So she organized a girls' team with players under the age of 12. She knew it would be the youngest girls' soccer team in the whole country. No one knew then that this team would completely change the lives of girls in Namibia. 
 
 3 It wasn't long before the girls loved the game, even though their field was filled with stones, thorns, and broken glass. Because they had no other girls' teams to compete with, Mary Beth <u>arranged<u> matches against the boys' teams. The boys were bigger and tougher, but the girls didn't back down. Like the boys, the girls learned to play fast and smart, and they learned ways to outsmart their stronger opponents.
 
 *Becoming the Pumpkins*
 
 4 Soon news spread about the Nordkamp girls' team. An American soccer team from Briarcliff Manor, New York, heard about them from friends and immediately sent all their uniforms and shoes to their ""soccer sisters."" When the bright orange uniforms arrived, the Nordkamp girls danced with delight.
 
 5 ""You look like a bunch of pumpkins,"" Mary Beth said. 
 
 6 A girl's voice called out, ""If we are pumpkins, we're beautiful pumpkins."" 
 
 7 With their new name—the Pumpkins—and uniforms, the experienced team was ready to enter tournament play. 
 
 8 An invitation arrived.
 
 *Tournament Play!*
 
 9 On December 1, 2006, the Pumpkins gathered and marched in a big orange line to a field near the Nordkamp Center. It was 8:00 A.M. The girls were excited but scared. 
 
 10 Their first opposing team laughed at the young players, but they didn't laugh for long. They quickly found out just how good the Pumpkins were. The Pumpkins beat that first team and then the next. But the strain began to show in the third match. This team was stronger, and the game was tied up until the last minute. Emma, the Pumpkins' kicker, was the Nordkamp girls' only hope. 
 
 11 Everyone was quiet as Emma lined up to take a direct free kick. She bent and ran at the ball, head down. She pulled back her leg and then—a solid kick. The ball flew past the diving goalie and into the back of the net. Emma had scored the game-winning goal. 
 
 12 The Pumpkins felt like the tournament winners, even though they had one more match to play. The only problem? Their final opponents had not yet arrived. Sitting on the grass and eating peanut-butter sandwiches, the Pumpkins waited impatiently for the team to show up. With only 10 minutes left before the deadline, two big buses marked Botswana pulled through the gate. They were nine hours late! 
 
 13 It was almost dark when the whistle blew for the match to begin at 7:30 P.M. The official looked at the tall women from Botswana and laughed at the little Pumpkins. He told the Pumpkins to forfeit so they could all go home. That made the Pumpkins angry. They took to the field. They didn't come to quit.
 
 *The Toughest Match*
 
 14 With all their might, the Pumpkins held off the Botswana team that night. The girls were diving left and right, kicking and running after the ball. This was the Pumpkins' toughest match.
 
 15 With only seconds left to play, the game remained scoreless. Then, out of nowhere, out of the dark, the ball shot into the Pumpkins' goal past their stunned goalie. The whistle blew. The game was over. The final score: Botswana 1, Pumpkins 0. 
 
 16 The Pumpkins had lost the match, but their courageous story made them famous. They had inspired others. In Namibia, schools began to sponsor girls' teams and offer soccer scholarships to girls who would study and play hard. 
 
 17 And it all began with these brave girls who loved the game and their team. They stepped up to meet their biggest challenge—and changed the world.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2021-staar-gr6-reading-test-tagged,1,"""1 ""Can you keep a secret?"" Elena and her older brother, Marcos, chatted on the phone, and his question left her intrigued. 
 
 2 Elena inquired, ""Of course! What is it?"" 
 
 3 ""Before I tell you, you must promise me you won't tell Mom and Dad,"" insisted Marcos. 
 
 4 ""I promise,"" Elena said nervously. ""Is something wrong?"" 
 
 5 ""No, I'm coming to visit for Mom and Dad's 25th-wedding-anniversary party next month,"" Marcos declared, revealing his enthusiasm as much as the news. 
 
 6 Elena squealed, ""That's awesome, Marcos! We haven't seen you since you moved to California. I can't wait to see you."" 
 
 7 ""I'll arrive on the 17th, the day before the party. Now promise me once more: don't tell anyone!"" 
 
 8 After they hung up, Elena flopped onto her bed to return to her homework assignment, but concentrating on her work proved <u>futile<u>; she was bursting with the news that her brother had entrusted to her. 
 
 9 ""You're happy,"" Mom observed later as Elena bounded down the stairs to dinner. 
 
 10 Elena tried to tame her enthusiasm, murmuring, ""Just had a good day, that's all."" She felt so elated that she worried she'd spill the news about Marcos's visit, but she managed to contain her secret throughout the entire meal and went to bed restless with excitement. 
 
 11 The next day Elena's cousin Gemma came over to watch a movie, and as the girls were trying to decide what to watch, Gemma noticed Elena beaming. 
 
 12 ""Excited to watch a movie, huh?"" Gemma asked. 
 
 13 Elena laughed. ""No—well, yes—but that's not it."" 
 
 14 ""So what's got you walking on clouds?"" Gemma prodded. Elena froze thoughtfully. Why couldn't she tell _just_ Gemma the news? She craned her neck into the hallway to confirm they were alone, and then she moved closer to Gemma. 
 
 15 ""Can you keep a secret?"" Elena asked quietly. ""Marcos is coming for Mom and Dad's anniversary party!"" Elena exclaimed, the secret pouring out of her like a waterfall.
 
 16 ""Awesome!"" Gemma shouted. 
 
 17 ""Shhh, keep your voice down!"" Elena instructed. ""It's a surprise, and I'm the only one who knows."" She felt a little guilty telling Gemma, but it was fine for her cousin to know—just not Mom and Dad. 
 
 18 ""Your secret's safe with me,"" Gemma promised. 
 
 19 Elena felt secure knowing her cousin promised to keep the secret, so Elena was caught off guard when one evening, about a week later, Elena's mom burst into Elena's room with eyes glistening and asked, ""Is Marcos really coming for the party?"" 
 
 20 Elena dropped the novel she was reading onto her lap and stared blankly at her mother. Suddenly, Elena's cheeks felt as if they were on fire. 
 
 21 ""I don't—I mean—why would Marcos be coming?"" Elena stammered. 
 
 22 ""It's OK, honey—you don't have to pretend,"" Mom said. ""Aunt Laura already told me the news."" 
 
 23 ""Aunt Laura? How did she know?"" 
 
 24 ""Gemma told her,"" Elena's mom answered. ""I can't wait to see Marcos!"" 
 
 25 ""Mom,"" Elena said, ""you and Dad _have_ to act surprised. You are not supposed to know about this!"" 
 
 26 Mom promised she wouldn't let Marcos know she was aware of his visit, but when Elena woke up on the morning of the 17th, she could smell Marcos's favorite cookies baking in the oven and could hear Mom running the vacuum in Marcos's room. Elena's stomach churned wildly all day long, although not from hunger, and the feeling only intensified further when Marcos walked through the door, a bouquet of flowers in hand, and Mom called out, ""Marcos, I thought you'd never get here!"" 
 
 27 As Marcos hugged Mom, he looked accusingly over her shoulder at Elena—the aroma of fresh cookies in the air whispered to him that his visit was no surprise. 
 
 28 The family ate dinner together and sat around the kitchen table talking, but Elena tentatively picked at her food. The evening was far from what Elena imagined. She barely participated in the conversation. When her parents headed to bed, Elena moved toward her own room, but Marcos held her back by her shoulder—and Elena knew why. 
 
 29 ""Elena,"" Marcos began while Elena braced herself, ""I'm really happy to see you, but I can't believe you didn't keep our secret—I really wanted to surprise Mom and Dad."" 
 
 30 ""If Gemma didn't have such a big mouth,"" Elena began defensively, tears building in her eyes. ""Gemma promised me she wouldn't tell! She must have told Aunt Laura, and Aunt Laura told Mom.""
 
 31 Marcos embraced Elena to comfort her. ""You're probably right, but remember, you were the _first_ person who promised not to tell,"" Marcos mildly scolded. 
 
 32 Elena frowned and then continued, ""I was just so excited, Marcos, but I'm sorry. I really messed up."" 
 
 33 ""Well,"" Marcos chuckled, ""at least one good thing came out of all this."" 
 
 34 ""What's that?"" Elena asked, sniffling. 
 
 35 Marcos reached for the tin container sitting on the kitchen table. ""Well, if Mom hadn't known I was coming,"" he said, ""she wouldn't have made all these cookies!"" He offered the container to her. ""Want one?"" 
 
 36 Elena cautioned, ""Mom said to save the rest for the anniversary party."" 
 
 37 Grabbing another cookie, Marcos replied, ""I won't tell anyone — I promise.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2021-staar-gr6-reading-test-tagged,3,""" 1 On October 13, 2012, the space shuttle _Endeavour,_ one of four retired NASA shuttles, began its last mission. This was not a trip into space, however. The shuttle began a two-day, twelve-mile crawl through the streets of Los Angeles, California, where it was put on display at the California Science Center. Needless to say, moving the shuttle through a major city proved daunting. After all, _Endeavour_ measures 122 feet long, 78 feet wide, and 57 feet tall. As one observer said, the move was a ""once-in-forever moment in history.""
 
 2 _Endeavour_ began this final voyage in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Strapped to the back of a specially adapted Boeing 747 airplane, it was flown across the country to Edwards Air Force Base in California. On a celebratory flight around its new home state, _Endeavour_ circled over the Capitol in Sacramento. It then flew over NASA's research center in San Jose and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. After soaring past the famous Hollywood sign, _Endeavour_ landed at the Los Angeles International Airport. But that was the easy part of the mission. The real challenge had only just begun.
 
 3 In all it took over 100 people to usher the shuttle through the streets of Los Angeles. Many engineers and technicians worked around the clock. Street signs and power lines were taken down to create a path. Huge steel plates were placed atop streets along the route. This was to protect water and sewer pipes below the asphalt from being broken under _Endeavour_ 's weight. A custom-made, 80-wheel vehicle towed _Endeavour_ across freeways and paraded the shuttle through neighborhoods. Several police officers were needed to redirect traffic as the shuttle passed. Dozens of photographers and filmmakers were on hand to capture every minute.
 
 4 This historic move, which cost approximately 10 million dollars to complete, also became a huge social event. Over one and a half million people lined the streets as _Endeavour_ inched along. People set up tents and sold hot dogs, baked goods, and _Endeavour_ T-shirts. The crowds clapped and cheered as the shuttle moved into view. The shuttle's top speed along the trip was just two miles per hour, giving crowds ample time to watch. It also made frequent stops along the way. Finally it reached the California Science Center. 
 
 5 _Endeavour_ is now part of a permanent exhibit. Every day people come to see the shuttle that flew so many daring missions into space. A special part of that exhibit is also dedicated to the amazing journey the retired shuttle made across the country and through Los Angeles to its new home.""",*Read the next two selections.

2021-staar-gr6-reading-test-tagged,4,"""1 Nature lovers from around the world come to see the Grand Canyon. They marvel at the giant walls of rock bordering a great chasm^1. In 2007 the world got a new way to experience this attraction—the Grand Canyon Skywalk. It is a horseshoe-shaped glass walkway that <u>protrudes<u> 70 feet beyond the canyon wall. People can look through the floor, straight into the canyon below.

 2 But this skywalk not only creates a unique attraction for tourists, it also solves a problem faced by its builders, members of the American Indian tribe called the Hualapai. Traditionally the South Rim of the Grand Canyon is the busiest part, attracting visitors and revenue to the area. However, about 2,000 tribe members of the Hualapai live in a rugged area known as Grand Canyon West, five hours away from the South Rim. Before building the Grand Canyon Skywalk, the Hualapai tried to encourage tourists to visit their part of the Grand Canyon, yet few people made the long journey. They needed an extreme attraction to bring new economic life to their home.

 3 Then one day David Jin, a businessman from Las Vegas, suggested this unique project to the Hualapai tribe members. However, it was not going to be simple. There were many factors to consider when designing the skywalk. How could glass hold the weight of many visitors? Would wind be a problem? What should the walkway look like?

 4 Though it would take a great amount of work, many tribe members liked this idea; they felt the skywalk would provide job opportunities. After much discussion tribal elders supported the idea to build the skywalk. A team of architects and engineers helped the tribe decide on the proper way to build the bridge, addressing various concerns. They settled on a horseshoe shape and took steps to maximize safety and performance.

 5 Building the Grand Canyon Skywalk took several years. Eight giant metal posts were embedded deep in the rocky ground, and an entrance building was constructed on top of the posts at the very edge of the canyon.

2021-staar-gr6-reading-test-tagged,5,"""1 Dr. Todd Hickey opens a rusted tin box filled to the brim with tattered pieces of 2‚000-year-old paper from Egypt. Dr. Hickey, a papyrologist (pap-eh-ROL-ah-jist), is excited about this rare treasure. It isn't covered in gold, but it is priceless. That's because those tattered pieces of paper are papyrus. Papyrus tells us much about the secrets of life in ancient Egypt. 
 
 2 The Egyptians made this paper from papyrus plants that grew near the Nile River. Before papyrus, Egyptians mostly used copper chisels to carve words called hieroglyphs into stone. Papyrus made writing easier.
 
 *Writing to Go*
 
 3 With papyrus, Egyptians could write signs and symbols using brushes, reed pens, and ink made from soot scraped out of cooking vessels and oil lamps. And they could take their writing wherever they went. 
 
 4 Dr. Hickey has already studied hundreds of the papyri. Some contain spells that the Egyptians wrote down and carried with them. They believed spells gave them magical protection or power. Other papyri give directions for making powerful medicine. Archaeologists even found 2,000-year-old homework. A schoolboy had copied his lesson over and over with a reed quill^1.
 
 *From Trash to Treasure*
 
 5 When papyri weren't needed anymore for writing, they were tossed in the trash. The Egyptians reused these unwanted papyri to make _papier-mâché._ They shaped masks for human mummies or used the papyri to wrap animal mummies. 
 
 6 ""Think of it as the ancient Egyptians' form of recycling,"" says Dr. Hickey. 
 
 7 Dr. Hickey works to uncover valuable writings in the waste paper. And that is no easy task. It can take days to unroll just one wad of paper. First it is dampened to help it soften and relax. Then the paper is unrolled a bit. Dirt and gunk are carefully scraped off. The papyrologists must be careful not to scrape away the ink or paint underneath the dirt. The paper is unrolled a bit more. When the papyrus is completely unrolled, papyrologists look for torn pieces that fit together. 
 
 8 After the pieces are joined, is the job finished? No. The secrets from the past are still hidden, because words are missing from the worn bits of papyrus. The handwriting is faded and in ancient languages.
 
 *It's All Greek to Me*
 
 9 To decode papyri, Dr. Hickey needs to know other languages besides Egyptian. Ancient Egypt was ruled by the Greeks and Romans at different times, so he has to read and think in Greek and Latin. 
 
 10 Once he figures out what a sentence means, he tries to guess what the missing words or letters are in the holes of the papyrus. 
 
 11 ""It's a challenge, but it is not impossible for papyrologists,"" Dr. Hickey says. ""H---e"" would lead me to think ‘horse' in some contexts, ‘house' in others."" 
 
 12 History leaps to life from each repaired papyrus. Dr. Hickey and other papyrologists found a police report to a royal <u>scribe<u> about a missing person. It reads: ""On the 5th of the present month when patrolling the fields near the village . . . I learn from the villagers that Theodotos son of Dositheos, having set out in that direction, has not yet returned. I make this report."" 
 
 13 The reporter also says that he found clues, but not the missing person. 
 
 14 Some papyri give archaeologists a good idea of what Egyptians read for fun. They enjoyed adventure stories, poetry, plays, and myths. 
 
 15 It will take years for Dr. Hickey to study all the papyri in the tin box. He picks up a completed papyrus covered in protective glass. The writing on the papyrus forms a triangle, and the words can be read in several directions. It says the Greek nonsense phrase for a magical spell—similar to abracadabra.
 
 16 Too bad it can't be used to make all the papyrus bits in the tin box fall together instantly. But we can look forward to learning more about Egyptian life as each piece is connected.""","*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2021-staar-gr7-reading-test,1,"""1 Just off the coast of Africa lies a small group of islands known as the Canary Islands. The second smallest of these islands is La Gomera. If you were to visit La Gomera, you might expect to hear the whistles of birds, such as canaries, in the air. Although you may indeed hear tweets drifting through the deep valleys and ravines, you would also hear a unique whistle not heard anywhere else in the world—and one that has nothing to do with birds. This whistle is called _Silbo Gomero,_ or just el _Silbo_ (the whistle) by the islanders. It's far more than an ordinary whistle. It's a spoken language.
 
 2 _El Silbo_ has a history that reaches back for many generations. No one is certain of its origin. Some <u>speculate<u> that it began as a northern African language. Historians do know that the whistled language was used by the original inhabitants of the island. When the Spanish explorers arrived during the 1500s and 1600s, they adopted the language and _el Silbo_ was widely spoken for centuries after. 
 
 3 _El Silbo_ translates a dialect of Spanish by assigning whistles of different pitch and length to each vowel or consonant sound. The whistle language contains up to four vowels and up to ten consonants used to compose words. One of the advantages to _el Silbo_ is that the sounds can travel up to two miles. Without using much energy, it can be heard much farther away than a shout. While there are a few other whistling languages in the world, _el Silbo_ is spoken by the largest group of people and is the only one that contains every vowel and consonant in the local spoken language.
 
 4 One older islander explains that when he first learned the language, it was a vital skill. Houses were far apart in those days, so learning to whistle was more a matter of necessity than pleasure. Whistling allowed islanders to deliver messages across the ravines without having to walk great distances around them. The whistles were often used to make public announcements or to send invitations to events. But as times and transportation methods changed, so did the habits of the people of La Gomera. By the 1980s _el Silbo_ began fading away. Before long only a few people could still whistle this unique language. The people of La Gomera realized that they were in danger of losing something that was precious to them. They recognized that _el Silbo_ was an important and unique part of their heritage. To preserve the language, the government took action and required that _el Silbo_ be taught in the schools. Today every elementary-school student in La Gomera takes classes in _el Silbo_. Even though the islanders all learn the language, it is still not spoken as widely as some would like. 
 
 5 Juan Carlos Hernández Marrero, a researcher at the Archaeological Museum of La Gomera, says that some islanders think that the language is not modern enough. They consider it an antique part of their culture. _El Silbo_ is heard mostly in schools and in restaurants where tourists come to hear whistling demonstrations. Most adults who whistle do so to entertain crowds of curious tourists. It is far from being the common language that it used to be. 
 
 6 Although some islanders consider the language to be a novelty, others embrace _el Silbo._ A young islander named Cyro is one of the few whistlers who learned the language directly from his parents instead of in school. His family eventually left the island to find jobs and lead new lives in a more modern place. Cyro left too but made his way back home to La Gomera. ""After being away for eight years, I decided to come back,"" Cyro explains. ""I like being in nature. I like my animals and my whistle. And here I will stay, because the island needs me."" Cyro loves whistling to communicate. He whistles with his friends and with his animals, a flock of playful goats. He is especially proud that his goats recognize his whistle. Cyro is helping to keep the tradition of _el Silbo_ alive.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in theansweronyouranswerdocument.*,*More Than a Whistle*,1,"1.

2021-staar-gr7-reading-test,2,"""1 ""Your elephant looks so alive, Kun Ya,"" Noi said, leaning close. 
 
 2 Her grandmother painted an elephant lumbering across a yellow silk umbrella. As she worked, her small body rocked with the thick, bold brush strokes. 
 
 3 ""The eyes even sparkle,"" added Noi's older sister, Ting. 
 
 4 Noi loved to be with Kun Ya and Ting in the jungle clearing, the three of them sitting on the bamboo mat, surrounded by pots of color. 
 
 5 Noi dipped her fingertip into the gray, then rubbed the slick paint slowly between her thumb and forefinger. 
 
 6 Usually Kun Ya asked Noi and Ting to mix the paints. As Noi blended colors to create new ones, she enjoyed the way the smooth texture slipped back and forth with her brush. 
 
 7 Ting was content to mix paint and wash brushes, but Noi always longed to paint. Sometimes Kun Ya let her paint simple things like leaves. Noi's whole body came alive with the shades of green. Her hands felt magical when she guided the brush. 
 
 8 ""The elephant is coming right toward us,"" Noi remarked. Even though she was eleven years old, she liked to pretend that Kun Ya's creatures were real. 
 
 9 Kun Ya laughed softly, and a breeze broke through the canopy of trees to let the sunshine in. 
 
 10 All morning, Noi and Ting had opened the umbrellas, getting them ready for Kun Ya's brush. They pushed the fretwork of bamboo slivers up the bamboo pole until the silk bloomed into <u>translucent<u> flowers of pinks, greens, purples. 
 
 11 Just before handing a new umbrella to Kun Ya, Noi liked to hold it up to the light, enjoying the weightless cascade of color on her face. 
 
 12 As Kun Ya finished, Noi carried each umbrella to the sunshine and hung it to dry. The forest floor felt soft under her bare feet. When breezes came up, the umbrellas floated back and forth like big soft bells.
 
 13 Kun Ya handed Ting the elephant umbrella. Ting stood up and twirled the umbrella overhead as she skipped around the clearing, her movements light and strong. ""Look, Noi, the elephant is dancing!"" 
 
 14 Noi laughed. 
 
 15 Kun Ya took up a small child's umbrella. She sketched in a pink hibiscus so quickly that it seemed as though her arm became part of the paintbrush. 
 
 16 Noi crouched close to watch. 
 
 17 Suddenly, Kun Ya held the umbrella out to Noi. ""Paint a butterfly landing on the flower."" 
 
 18 ""Me?"" Noi asked, staring at the green silk. A butterfly was much more complicated than simple leaves. 
 
 19 Kun Ya still challenged her, offering the umbrella. 
 
 20 ""But, Kun Ya, I don't know how."" 
 
 21 ""You've watched me for years, Noi. Now try yourself."" 
 
 22 Noi dipped the brush into the yellow. Her hand trembled as she brought the brush near the silk stretched across the bamboo frame. She glanced at the butterflies dancing close by, then began to paint yellow wings above Kun Ya's jungle flower. 
 
 23 ""Your trembling is good, Noi,"" said Kun Ya. ""That's the way the butterfly moves. Let the movement spread to your whole body, not just your fingers. Paint with all of you. Become the butterfly."" 
 
 24 In an instant, Noi understood what Kun Ya meant. She sensed the butterflies hovering in the thick shade of the banana leaves then flittering out into the sunshine. The flit of the butterflies moved into her, then out into the brush, so the paint seemed to lay itself down. 
 
 25 Noi held the umbrella away from her. ""I did it!"" 
 
 26 ""It's pretty,"" said Ting. 
 
 27 Kun Ya smiled and began to collect the brushes, dropping them one by one into a jar of water. 
 
 28 Noi and Ting laid their heads down in Kun Ya's lap to wait while the umbrellas dried. Kun Ya stroked their hair and sang, ""The yellow bird flies away,"" while Noi gazed at the flowers and creatures that Kun Ya had created. The shadows of the trees crisscrossed Kun Ya's face as she sang. 
 
 29 When the umbrellas were dry, Ting and Noi closed them up, the way that flowers close themselves up for the night. 
 
 30 ""We worked hard today,"" said Kun Ya.
 
 31 Kun Ya had done the real work, Noi thought. But then she recalled her butterfly umbrella, which lay in the basket with Kun Ya's umbrellas. She had worked too.""","*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question. Then fill in theansweronyouranswerdocument.*

2021-staar-gr7-reading-test,3,"""1 Art can come in many forms and from many places. Sometimes it can be created quickly, and other times its creation requires a <u>prolonged<u> effort. Over a century ago, a mail carrier named Ferdinand Cheval began a masterpiece that took over 33 years to complete.
 
 *Inspiration*
 
 2 Cheval walked many miles each day along his route in Hauterives, France, delivering mail. The route, which was once below sea level, was carpeted with fossils and loose rocks. One day in 1879, as Cheval trudged across the steep terrain, he stumbled over a stone. Admiring its sculptural shape, he dropped it into his pocket. 
 
 3 Cheval was so enthralled by the beautiful stone that he began collecting more. The stones reminded him of a dream he once had of building a fantasy-like palace made from stones. Cheval chose to fulfill the dream. He said to himself: ""Since nature wants to make the sculpture, I will make the stonework and the architecture."" 
 
 4 Forty-three-year-old Cheval continued collecting stones along his route for almost 20 years. He carried them in his pockets or in baskets—and eventually in a wheelbarrow. Then he began building what would become known as the Ideal Palace. When he retired from the postal service at age 60, his hobby became a vocation to which he would devote his life.
 
 *The Ideal Palace*
 
 5 Cheval used concrete, lime, and wire to cement the stones in place. At night he labored by the light of an oil lamp. He followed no design rules and mixed cultures from around the world. His jumbled creation has global and distinctive inspiration—including handsome Hindu architecture and a medieval castle with stones that look like fur. 
 
 6 When Cheval began he said that people laughed at his idea. Cheval said he was called ""an old fool who fills his garden with stones."" But as his palace took shape, people's criticisms were replaced by awed respect. 
 
 7 Cheval spent 33 years building his palace. He was in his seventies when he finished. The final structure was 75 feet long, 35 feet tall, and 40 feet wide. He completed it in 1912.
 
 *Cheval's Gift*
 
 8 Up to 120,000 tourists visit the Ideal Palace annually. It is considered a historical monument and once appeared on a French postage stamp. The Ideal Palace has inspired artists and writers the world over, and its likeness has been displayed at New York City's Museum of Modern Art.
 
 9 Cheval's uniqueness helped him single-handedly create a marvel beyond duplication. Untrained in architecture or construction, he nonetheless had a vision. Cheval once said, ""Whatever your age, whatever you wish to achieve, if you are courageous, persistent, and hardworking, you are sure to succeed.""",*Read the next two selections.

2021-staar-gr7-reading-test,4,"""1 The villagers laughed as they watched their neighbor, farmer Yacouba Sawadogo, digging dozens of holes in the rock-hard soil of his field. Each pit _(or _zaï,_ as Sawadogo called them)_ was about a foot wide and eight inches deep. The people laughed even harder when he began filling each hole with a mixture of cattle manure, leaves, and any other organic material he could find. Finally, he carefully buried seeds in each compost bed. ""Do you actually expect those seeds to grow without water?"" someone called.

2 It was 1980, and Burkina Faso was suffering a ten-year drought. Here in this semiarid region between the Sahara Desert and the rain forests of West Africa, water was always scarce. Now it was almost nonexistent. Like other neighboring countries, Burkina Faso was suffering from desertification. This involves a drying, hardening, and eroding of the soil that is overfarmed, overgrazed, and overpopulated.

3 Sawadogo patiently explained that rain would come eventually. When it did, most of it would run off of the ground's surface, which was baked hard as concrete. But in his field, the _zaïs_ would catch and hold much more of the precious water than the dry ground could alone. Moisture would linger longer underground through the dry season. The damp, rich compost would continue to nourish his sprouting crops and the small trees he planted. Sawadogo said that in 20 years' time, he could visualize a lush, green field and forest taking place of the rocky, barren desert. _Zaï_ farming was really an old method that Africans had used long ago, Sawadogo said. It had worked once; perhaps it was time to try it again.

4 But his neighbors still scoffed. What did Sawadogo know?

5 To the amazement of many, Sawadogo was right. Today his patch of green forest grows in the midst of a desert. Slowly over the years, many of those who laughed at their neighbor have now joined him. More and more fields in West Africa are being rescued from desertification using Sawadogo's _zaï_ and other water harvesting processes. Sawadogo travels all over the region and spreads the message of how _zaï_ farming can transform the landscape and save lives. He knows there is hope for a brighter future.""",,*Trees Rise in the Desert*,,,,,,,,,,Yacouba Sawadogo Planting a Tree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2021-staar-gr8-reading-test-tagged,1,"""1 The first-day jitters were impossible to ignore as Lucy Falls walked through the tall glass doors of her new school. Though she was excited for the opportunity to study cinema at the School of the ARTS, she now wondered if she had made a terrible mistake by transferring in the middle of the year. Trying to shake off the early morning's frustration, she wiped her clammy hands on her navy sundress and focused her attention on finding her first-period class. 
 
 2 Finishing her paperwork had taken forever. The office aide had instructed her to go back through the foyer and take the staircase on the right down to the basement. Just as Lucy started walking, the bell for first period rang, sounding to her like a signal of doom. 
 
 3 _Great,_ she thought. _Now not only am I new, I'll be late too._ 
 
 4 She marched quickly through the foyer and made it to the stairwell. Distracted by a group of tardy students who had congregated at the top to take selfies, Lucy tripped over her first step. She stumbled, fell, and then skidded all the way to the bottom, purse and bag sliding down behind her. 
 
 5 ""Smooth feet, newbie!"" 
 
 6 ""That's gotta hurt!"" 
 
 7 As she picked herself up, Lucy couldn't decide what hurt more—her body or her pride. She took a few deep breaths and realized she was now standing in front of her first-period class. She worried that the longer she waited to get to class, the worse this day would go. She needed a second chance to make a good first impression. 
 
 8 _Only like four people saw me fall, she told herself. No big deal._ 
 
 9 First period went by uneventfully, and Lucy even introduced herself to a couple of the girls who sat behind her. By the time she was headed to second period, she had relegated the fall to the back of her mind. 
 
 10 She pushed open the door to Intro to Cinema, the class she was most looking forward to at this new school. Students looked her way, and whispers snaked from group to group. Lucy felt her face get hot, and she decided that maybe this day actually could get worse. A couple of kids were huddled in the back around one of the classroom laptops, and she assumed they were talking about her. 
 
 11 _How in the world had word gotten around so fast?_ As she stood awkwardly facing the class, the mantra her mother had repeated since she was a little girl came to mind. ""Remember, honey. Lucy never falls,"" her mother would say when things didn't go Lucy's way.
 
 12 _I bet Mom never imagined this scenario,_ Lucy mused, rolling her eyes. 
 
 13 ""Settle down, class,"" the teacher said sternly to the students, who quieted. She directed her attention toward Lucy and gave her a welcoming smile. ""You must be Lucy Falls. Today we are discussing our 30-second film project. I believe the details were in the outline you received before you transferred. You can join group four. I'm sure whatever is so distracting on that laptop will be gone by the time I make it over there,"" she said, directing a pointed look to the group at the back of the classroom. 
 
 14 Fearing the worst, Lucy approached the group. 
 
 15 ""That fall was epic!"" An enthusiastic redhead beamed at Lucy as she sat down. Grinning widely he stuck his hand out and shook Lucy's.
 
 16 ""I'm Rodney!"" 
 
 17 The other group members, one looking intently at the laptop and the other quickly jotting notes into a journal, ignored Lucy. 
 
 18 Lucy sighed. ""I don't know if that's necessarily the right word to describe it."" Rodney chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. ""Someone was recording a video of my friend, and it's impossible to miss your wipeout in the background!"" 
 
 19 The girl who was huddled over the laptop giggled. For the millionth time that day, Lucy's face got hot, and again she began to doubt the wisdom of transferring to the magnet school altogether. 
 
 20 Rodney continued. ""Hey, I hope you don't think I'm making fun of you! Actually, I think you're going to save our 30-second film project! Your name has perfect <u>potential<u> for a star character—Lucy Falls!"" He gestured as if her name were shining in lights. ""The fact that you also _fell,_ quite gracefully I might add, makes it the perfect play on words! You're going to be the inspiration for our project!"" 
 
 21 Lucy allowed herself a small smile. It hadn't been a good start, but Rodney was definitely making her first day less terrible. 
 
 22 ""I've been working on some edits from this clip that we have,"" the girl on the laptop said suddenly, turning the computer toward Lucy and showing her what she'd been working on so intently. ""I'm Alicia—sorry—I wanted to capture my thoughts before I forgot. We've been struggling to come up with a concept, but this is sheer genius!"" 
 
 23 As Alicia and Rodney talked excitedly, Lucy's embarrassment began to dissipate. She listened for a few moments, watching Alicia's film clip transform her stairway disaster into drama; then, she pulled up a chair and joined in as the group brainstormed ideas for _Lucy Falls._
 
 24 Her mother's mantra came to mind, and Lucy smiled to herself. _Well, Mom, sometimes Lucy DOES fall . . . but at least she makes a lasting impression!_""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

2021-staar-gr8-reading-test-tagged,2,"""1 In February, scientists exploring the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii made an amazing discovery. They had sent a remotely operated vehicle thousands of feet below the waves to take video of the deep sea. Dozens of team members were watching the live video feed from a ship on the ocean's surface and from offices on land. Suddenly, a mysterious creature appeared on their screens. It was a white, ghostlike octopod. That's a category of eight-armed ocean animals that includes the common octopus. But it did not look like any octopod the scientists had seen before.
 
 2 ""I was really excited because I recognized it was something unusual,"" says zoologist Michael Vecchione.
 
 3 Vecchione and the other scientists work for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The government agency was working on a project to map the ocean floor near Hawaii and study the ocean life there. The new octopod was an exciting—and unexpected—find.
 
 *A Unique Species*
 
 4 The newly discovered octopod has tiny eyes and a jelly-like body. It has very few muscles. That's because there is little food in the deep sea, and a lot of food is needed to build muscle. The creature also has some unusual characteristics that set it apart from other octopods. ""The first thing that makes it really unusual is that it doesn't have any chromatophores, or pigment cells,"" Vecchione told Scholastic Online. Pigment is what gives animals color. Because this creature has no pigment, it is very pale. It also has fewer rows of suckers on its arms than other octopods do. Suckers are body parts that octopods use to grasp objects. Those two characteristics lead scientists to believe that it is a completely new octopod species.
 
 5 The creature is also a record setter. It was spotted at about 14,000 feet—or 2.6 miles—beneath the waves. Some other types of octopods are known to live that deep in the ocean, but they all have fins on the sides of their bodies. The new creature belongs to a category of octopods that do not have fins. Until this discovery, no finless octopod had been found below about 13,000 feet.
 
 *More to Discover*
 
 6 Because of the octopod's ghostlike appearance, it has been given the nickname Casper. (Casper the Friendly Ghost was a popular character in an old cartoon.) But it cannot be officially named until scientists get a specimen to examine more closely. Unfortunately, that's not likely to happen anytime soon. 
 
 7 ""The likelihood of encountering another one of these octopods is very small,"" Vecchione says. ""So it wouldn't be a very productive use of our time and resources to try to look for one."" 
 
 8 Still, the octopod's discovery is exciting because it suggests that many more undiscovered species could live in the deep sea and other places on Earth. ""It illustrates how little we know about life on our planet—and how much more we can find,"" Vecchione says.""",*Read the next two selections.

2021-staar-gr8-reading-test-tagged,3,"""1 Peering through the thick, white mist, Marcio Pie crouches among the gnarled vines. The shuffles, calls, and chirps of countless animals, birds, and insects fill the cool evening air. Pie is listening hard for the singing of tiny frogs. He and his team have tiptoed to the location where they last heard them singing. The scientists quietly begin picking up handfuls of leaves and <u>screening<u> them. If the scientists are lucky, they will find one of the frogs. But they must look very carefully because these frogs are smaller than a fingernail.

 2 Pie is one of a handful of scientists who has discovered a new tiny frog species. These little creatures make their home in the cloud forests high in the mountains of Brazil. They are brightly colored with poisonous skin that protects them, and they live in ""leaf litter,"" or piles of dead leaves.

 3 Locating the frogs is extremely difficult. ""Sometimes it's very frustrating,"" says Pie. ""You can hear them singing, and there's probably hundreds of them, but you simply can't catch them!"" The frogs detect the vibrations that occur when people walk. Suddenly they become silent, staying that way for about half an hour, forcing scientists to forage through the leaves.

 4 In Papua, New Guinea, scientist C. I. Moore also recently discovered a miniature frog. At only about 6.858 millimeters, it may be even smaller than the ones Pie found. This frog's brownish-green hue provides excellent camouflage. Moore first discovered the frog by its unique call. His team began picking up leaf litter and putting it in plastic bags until they caught sight of the new frogs. The tiny amphibians were incredibly difficult to catch because they jump like crickets.

 5 In spite of the countless challenges, new tiny frogs are being found among the planet's habitats that have previously been understudied. ""That's what's exciting about this field,"" declares Moore.

2021-staar-gr8-reading-test-tagged,5,"""1 Carol LeResche got the phone call she'd been waiting for. She lives in Sheridan, Wyoming, and was told a resident was picking zucchini at Thorne-Rider Park. 
 
 2 ""It's exactly what we hoped would happen when we put in the food forest,"" explained LeResche. She is the park's food forest coordinator. 
 
 3 In May, the Powder River Basin Resource Council in Sheridan received a $3,500 grant from the Wyoming Department of Agriculture. The money was used to help turn a former BMX park into an edible landscape. It's a place where all of the fruits, vegetables and nuts are free for the taking. 
 
 4 Unlike some parks with strict ""no picking"" policies, or parks where foraging is permitted but plantings emphasize aesthetics over edibles and just a fraction of the species can be consumed, food forests are designed to provide bountiful crops. Residents are encouraged to harvest them. And although there are no solid statistics on the number of food forests, the concept appears to be taking root. 
 
 5 At Thorne-Rider Park, zucchini was the first vegetable to ripen in the brand new food forest. As the other edibles mature, LeResche hopes residents will dig up potatoes for supper. They can gather raspberries to make jam or snack on ripe figs plucked straight from the trees. 
 
 6 ""We think it's important to put public food in public spaces,"" she said. 
 
 7 Food forests may seem like a spin-off of community gardens. But there are distinct differences. Residents often have to pay to rent plots in community gardens. They must invest in the seeds. They also must devote the labor required to maintain their plots. In contrast, food forests are funded through grants. Until the forests are self-sustaining, volunteers handle the labor. All that residents have to do is show up and pick their fill. 
 
 8 Food forests also provide different kinds of fresh produce than community gardens. The food forests emphasize perennials like fruit and nut trees and berry bushes over annual vegetables. 
 
 9 They also provide essential forest canopy that is lacking in urban areas. The canopy helps to minimize the heat island effect. It also provides community gathering spaces. Residents can participate in tours and classes. Or they can just relax among the fruit trees.
 
 10 ""Our desire to be more connected to where our food comes from is one of the reasons there is a real trend toward integrating agriculture into neighborhoods and communities,"" explained Daron ""Farmer D"" Joffe. He is the founding director of Coastal Roots Farm. The farm is a nonprofit. It manages an eight-acre food forest. It is in Encinitas, California. 
 
 11 Asheville, North Carolina, is believed to be home to the first food forest. Forty varieties of fruit and nut trees are found in the city's George Washington Carver Edible Park. It was founded in 1997. More than a decade later, similar projects began to sprout up. They can be found in cities like Portland, Oregon, San Francisco and Seattle. 
 
 12 Most food forests are similar in approach. They bring together parks and recreation districts (which provide land), nonprofit groups and volunteers who handle the labor and maintenance. The designs are similar, too. 
 
 13 Food forests are based on permaculture design. It's a model that emphasizes sustainable and mostly self-sufficient agricultural production. To achieve this, most food forests incorporate stacked layers of edible plants from root crops, ground cover, vines and herbs to shrubs and trees. From the ground up, the edibles might include beets, strawberries, grapes, basil, blueberries, fruit and nut trees. 
 
 14 The food forest model is less labor intensive than conventional agriculture. An edible forest is similar to a hardwood forest. There is no rotating of crops, weeding or mowing. 
 
 15 Coastal Roots Farm has built food access into its mission for the food forest. The eight-acre forest was planted this spring. When the harvest is ready, a portion will be donated to food-insecure communities through food banks. The rest will be available for public harvesting.
 
 16 But critics warn that these edible landscapes could be problematic. The concept is relatively new. And it takes at least three years for fruit and nut trees and berry bushes to start producing meaningful amounts of fresh food. This makes it difficult to know whether food forests will have an impact on food deserts. 
 
 17 Volunteer-driven projects can fall apart if the group lacks cohesion or loses interest. Lack of funding can also be problematic. In Sheridan, the original $3,500 grant helped start the project. LeResche estimated it will take $50,000 to complete the food forest plan.
 
 18 Pests are an oft-cited concern, too. 
 
 19 ""All trees need maintenance and fruit trees are no different,"" Joffe admitted. ""If a food forest is well managed, there is no issue."" 
 
 20 After all, LeResche explained, food forests are about a lot more than food. ""We also want to provide a community gathering space that is productive and beautiful where people can cultivate a relationship with the land. And get connected to delicious, healthy produce.""",*Read the selection and choose the best answer to each question.

15 *SAMANTHA'S MOM* : It's not going to be easy for either one of you, Sam. Alyssa has always been a good friend to you. But you can't let her make your decisions for you. This is what growing up is about—making your own decisions and living with the consequences. Just follow your heart, and Alyssa will come around.

21 *SAMANTHA* : Alyssa, wait up! 

22 *ALYSSA* : _[Sarcastically.]_ Wow, Sam, I'm surprised you have time to leave your desk. The school newspaper seems to be consuming all your time. 

23 *SAMANTHA* : Come on, Alyssa. Don't be mad. Orchestra is a year-round commitment, and I really wanted to try writing for the newspaper. Besides, don't you like being first violin? 

24 *ALYSSA* : You think that I'm first violin? Well, I'm not. I'm still second violin. Newspaper is first violin. 

25 *SAMANTHA* : _[Baffled.]_ What do you mean? 

26 *ALYSSA* : _[Sighing.]_ Yes, I'm first violin in orchestra, but I'm not first violin to you. I'm still playing second fiddle, while you're busy working on the newspaper. 

27 *SAMANTHA* : Alyssa, you're my best friend and always will be, but I had to do this for me. Listen, I've got a mandatory deadline to make, but check out the newspaper tomorrow. I think you might like what you see!

31 *ALYSSA* : Thanks! 

32 *SAMANTHA* : _[Enters the science lab and approaches Alyssa timidly.]_ Well . . . what do you think? 

33 *ALYSSA* : I don't know what to say, Sam. I can't believe that I'm the topic of your first feature article! I'm sorry for being such a jerk. You're a really good writer. 

34 *SAMANTHA* : _[Smiles and hugs Alyssa.]_ No worries. By the way, I've been looking everywhere for you. Why are you in here instead of in the orchestra room? 

35 *ALYSSA* : _[Stepping back and smiling.]_ I needed to find something to do to keep my mind off of missing you too much, so I decided to give robotics a try. I know what you're thinking: Me? Robotics? But, yeah, I really like it, and I have you to thank. You let me know that it's OK to try new things.
